(All characters, organizations, locations,)

2
00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:09.472
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.601
(Episode 13)

4
00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.794
He pretended to be confident,

5
00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:35.533
but he looks nervous.

6
00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:38.503
He looks very scared.

7
00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:42.734
Mr. Choi.

8
00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:45.103
Director Cha is behind all this.

9
00:00:47.073 --> 00:00:48.374
(Don't hold the press conference.)

10
00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:57.054
Noo Ri.

11
00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:01.194
When did you wake up?

12
00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:05.793
What are you doing?

13
00:01:25.843 --> 00:01:27.114
It's nice to meet you.

14
00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:30.483
I'm the brother of Juhan Air Flight 801's...

15
00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.153
co-pilot, Kim Bum Joon.

16
00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:33.853
I'm Kim Min Joon.

17
00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:43.963
Mr. Choi, don't hold the press conference.

18
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.204
Don't turn on the black box. Just leave.

19
00:01:46.804 --> 00:01:47.873
This is Noo Ri.

20
00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:51.004
Director Cha is meeting my father.

21
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.573
They'll dump it on Mr. Kim and you.

22
00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:55.543
Director Cha is behind all this.

23
00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:57.174
Kim Bum Joon's brother!

24
00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:04.314
You jerk.

25
00:02:08.123 --> 00:02:09.253
You jerk.

26
00:02:10.093 --> 00:02:11.623
Hey, you.

27
00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:14.223
Don't you dare say another word.

28
00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:26.674
Today at 11am,

29
00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:29.413
the press conference of the JH Flight 801...

30
00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:31.144
co-pilot's brother...

31
00:02:31.144 --> 00:02:33.614
was stopped due to...

32
00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:36.554
an interruption by a man.

33
00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:38.924
The man is identified as Mr. Choi who had lost...

34
00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:40.683
a family member on JH Flight 801.

35
00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:43.294
He attacked Mr. Kim standing behind a podium.

36
00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:44.794
Security guards stopped him...

37
00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:47.463
and pulled him out of the press conference.

38
00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:51.033
Mr. Kim, the brother of JH Flight 801 co-pilot,

39
00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:53.304
has raised issues regarding...

40
00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:55.003
JH Flight accident.

41
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:56.373
He was expected to give the full story...

42
00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:59.644
during the press conference.

43
00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:00.774
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:03.713
Why should you be?

45
00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:05.843
What did you do wrong?

46
00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:08.153
Pardon me?

47
00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:12.924
Look how awkward he looks.

48
00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:15.153
He's so tense.

49
00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.954
One man is acting as a victim,

50
00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:18.493
and the other as an assailant.

51
00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:21.334
Doesn't it look funny?

52
00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.163
Dad.

53
00:03:26.304 --> 00:03:27.634
Good job, Hong Joo.

54
00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.533
No matter how much they bark,

55
00:03:30.903 --> 00:03:33.174
no one will listen to them.

56
00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:35.144
They probably realized it by now.

57
00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.663
Mr. Gebauer. Since you're German, you must...

58
00:03:56.663 --> 00:03:59.003
not know how serious blackmailing is in Korea.

59
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:00.104
Blackmailing?

60
00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:01.274
Do you have proof?

61
00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:03.174
On various websites,

62
00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:06.204
related articles are published as a headline.

63
00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:11.313
You went to see Lee Young Ho at Juhan Air.

64
00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:13.283
I'll sue Juhan Air and expose everything.

65
00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:16.014
You blackmailed that you'll file a lawsuit.

66
00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:17.824
You called Lee Young Ho to pressure him...

67
00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.853
for a meeting with the vice president.

68
00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:25.494
You said you'll call me after thinking over.

69
00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.764
You haven't called me yet.

70
00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.463
If it's okay with you,

71
00:04:29.463 --> 00:04:32.064
I'll see you at JH tomorrow.

72
00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:34.733
I'd like to meet Vice President Joo.

73
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.004
Since they didn't do what you asked,

74
00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:39.944
you created a mess at the press conference.

75
00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:41.744
It's considered as obstruction of business...

76
00:04:41.744 --> 00:04:43.173
and threat.

77
00:04:43.874 --> 00:04:46.084
You can be sentenced up to five years for...

78
00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:47.954
business obstruction and three years for threat.

79
00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:50.954
Even if you get probation, you can be deported.

80
00:04:50.954 --> 00:04:52.283
I didn't blackmail him.

81
00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:53.283
Listen.

82
00:04:53.923 --> 00:04:55.793
Lee Young Ho quit working at JH...

83
00:04:55.793 --> 00:04:57.694
without doing what you asked him to do.

84
00:04:57.694 --> 00:04:59.764
That's why you accused him of stalking and murder.

85
00:04:59.764 --> 00:05:00.923
Mr. Gebauer.

86
00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:03.894
You found me alone at a restaurant yesterday...

87
00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:06.103
and accused me of being a murderer.

88
00:05:08.134 --> 00:05:09.973
It's really strange.

89
00:05:10.334 --> 00:05:11.444
If you're a lawyer,

90
00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.744
you must've passed a bar.

91
00:05:14.103 --> 00:05:15.973
You probably have a lot of money too.

92
00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:20.184
But why would you keep murdering people?

93
00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:22.483
You killed Ko Jin Chul,

94
00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:25.124
and you tried to kill me twice too.

95
00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:26.954
Why did you do that?

96
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.093
By any chance,

97
00:05:29.293 --> 00:05:30.793
are you a psychopath?

98
00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:37.134
Listen, Mr. Gebauer.

99
00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.264
Like your brother,

100
00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:42.803
you must also have a mental problem.

101
00:05:43.204 --> 00:05:45.504
Wasn't the pilot depressed or something?

102
00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:47.744
Go to a hospital before you turn out like him.

103
00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:49.744
Watch what you say, Detective.

104
00:05:49.744 --> 00:05:50.774
Mr. Choi.

105
00:05:51.913 --> 00:05:53.744
What you've done is worse.

106
00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:56.814
You illegally copied the memory board...

107
00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.353
of the flight's black box,

108
00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:01.093
and showed it to the chief of Prosecutors' Office.

109
00:06:02.454 --> 00:06:05.923
What makes you act so recklessly?

110
00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:06.923
Detective.

111
00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:09.293
Did you listen to the original file?

112
00:06:09.293 --> 00:06:10.334
The original?

113
00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:12.733
What you claim to be the original?

114
00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:15.074
- How can I believe that? - Detective.

115
00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.374
How can I?

116
00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:19.704
He's delusional and guilty of blackmailing.

117
00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:21.713
This guy forged evidence.

118
00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:24.814
How can I trust a group of criminals?

119
00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:25.814
You punk.

120
00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:30.353
Don't you know about presumed innocence?

121
00:06:30.353 --> 00:06:31.983
Do a fair investigation.

122
00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:33.024
What did you say?

123
00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:34.923
How dare you?

124
00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:39.163
All of you are on the same team, right?

125
00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:41.334
What's your name and social security number?

126
00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:46.363
Park Soon Jung.

127
00:06:46.663 --> 00:06:48.374
790128.

128
00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:50.434
- 1648... - Soon Jung.

129
00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:52.574
Kang Woo.

130
00:06:55.574 --> 00:06:56.913
Darn it.

131
00:07:06.184 --> 00:07:08.454
He could be sentenced to five years.

132
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.324
I could be sentenced to 10 years for false evidence.

133
00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:12.764
Is that right?

134
00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:16.963
Lawyer Lee Young Ho?

135
00:07:17.463 --> 00:07:19.704
You know very well, Mr. Choi.

136
00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.103
Cha Hong Joo got us.

137
00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:24.744
That's not true, Mr. Choi.

138
00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:27.574
It was me who forged evidence.

139
00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:30.473
I copied it.

140
00:07:30.473 --> 00:07:32.113
- Hey. - Detective.

141
00:07:32.814 --> 00:07:34.343
It was all done by me.

142
00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:35.454
Stop it.

143
00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.153
It was all done by me,

144
00:07:37.153 --> 00:07:40.153
so please call the embassy of Germany.

145
00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:42.994
- Call the consul. - Kim Min Joon.

146
00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:45.293
Please call the embassy of Germany.

147
00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:48.394
Please call the consul.

148
00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:58.374
Why are you taking every blame?

149
00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:01.673
It's a give-and-take.

150
00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:04.244
Last time you took it upon yourself...

151
00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:06.043
when the prosecution arrested you.

152
00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:08.113
So it's my turn this time.

153
00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.653
This time, it's a different scale.

154
00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:12.754
They fabricated the proof.

155
00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:13.783
No.

156
00:08:14.084 --> 00:08:15.923
They didn't make it.

157
00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:17.353
I did.

158
00:08:18.194 --> 00:08:21.394
I should've listened to you.

159
00:08:21.394 --> 00:08:24.363
You told me to stay low and do nothing.

160
00:08:24.564 --> 00:08:27.004
But I ran around and got caught.

161
00:08:28.434 --> 00:08:29.934
I'll take all the punishment.

162
00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:31.574
If you get deported,

163
00:08:32.574 --> 00:08:33.803
you can never return.

164
00:08:33.803 --> 00:08:34.943
I won't come back.

165
00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:36.313
It's no big deal.

166
00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:41.913
Your brother is here.

167
00:08:45.724 --> 00:08:46.724
You're right.

168
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.594
He'll stay here forever.

169
00:08:51.124 --> 00:08:53.793
As the murderer who crashed the plane.

170
00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:01.073
Where are you going?

171
00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.274
Why would you meet with Director Cha?

172
00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:03.703
I can't just do nothing.

173
00:09:04.604 --> 00:09:06.203
Are you going to beg her?

174
00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:08.443
She won't cut you any slack.

175
00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:11.014
In any case, I should talk to her.

176
00:09:11.244 --> 00:09:12.943
Ms. Jang. Hey, Ha Ri.

177
00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:29.533
(Vice President Joo Hyun Ki)

178
00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:31.764
Vice president of JH Group?

179
00:09:32.764 --> 00:09:34.374
Yes, that's me.

180
00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:37.274
Right?

181
00:09:37.573 --> 00:09:39.673
JH's previous legal affairs manager?

182
00:09:40.673 --> 00:09:41.744
Yes, Vice President Joo.

183
00:09:42.274 --> 00:09:43.614
Vice President Joo.

184
00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:45.114
Hi.

185
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.413
It's nice to see you here.

186
00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.653
You're glad to see me too, right?

187
00:09:49.653 --> 00:09:51.923
- Am I? - I'm sure you are.

188
00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:55.354
Mr. Choi Kang Woo here...

189
00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:57.994
and Mr. Gebauer over there.

190
00:09:58.964 --> 00:09:59.994
Please release them.

191
00:10:00.293 --> 00:10:02.464
Well... The charges are clear.

192
00:10:02.464 --> 00:10:03.864
No, they aren't.

193
00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:07.104
Mr. Gebauer is probably charged with...

194
00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:09.333
obstruction of business and blackmail.

195
00:10:10.634 --> 00:10:13.203
He has never obstructed...

196
00:10:13.203 --> 00:10:14.474
JH's business...

197
00:10:14.474 --> 00:10:16.514
nor blackmailed us.

198
00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:21.783
Mr. Jan Gebauer lost his brother.

199
00:10:22.614 --> 00:10:25.453
He told us of his sad and pitiful story,

200
00:10:25.453 --> 00:10:28.193
so we were having a respectful...

201
00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:30.653
and courteous conversation.

202
00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:31.663
But...

203
00:10:33.264 --> 00:10:34.764
the ex-legal affairs manager...

204
00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:36.464
who quit his job...

205
00:10:36.464 --> 00:10:39.403
didn't know what was going on...

206
00:10:39.403 --> 00:10:41.874
and reported an innocent person.

207
00:10:44.134 --> 00:10:46.803
Is Mr. Choi charged with forging proof?

208
00:10:50.173 --> 00:10:51.344
Did he forge this?

209
00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:52.943
Yes, he did.

210
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.043
No.

211
00:10:54.813 --> 00:10:56.614
He didn't forge it. He copied it.

212
00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:00.083
I asked him to make a copy.

213
00:11:00.283 --> 00:11:01.594
Right, Mr. Choi?

214
00:11:01.754 --> 00:11:02.793
Is that so?

215
00:11:02.793 --> 00:11:03.894
Of course.

216
00:11:04.323 --> 00:11:06.193
You made a copy according to my order.

217
00:11:06.193 --> 00:11:08.063
That doesn't count as forging evidence.

218
00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:11.163
Isn't that right, sir?

219
00:11:11.464 --> 00:11:13.033
Well, yes.

220
00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:18.004
Release Mr. Choi and Mr. Gebauer now.

221
00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.703
What are you doing, Vice President Joo?

222
00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:22.244
What do you think?

223
00:11:22.244 --> 00:11:24.413
I'm releasing you and taking my stuff back.

224
00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:30.083
Can't I take this?

225
00:11:33.124 --> 00:11:34.224
Is he...

226
00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:37.254
Here to take the original black box?

227
00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:38.264
Detective.

228
00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:39.793
The proof of an ongoing case...

229
00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:41.433
What do you mean by that?

230
00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:44.193
I, Vice President of JH Group,

231
00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:45.864
said I was never blackmailed.

232
00:11:45.864 --> 00:11:48.173
I'm the owner of this item,

233
00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:50.203
and I ordered Mr. Choi.

234
00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:51.874
What more is there to be investigated?

235
00:11:55.573 --> 00:11:56.874
Conclude the case...

236
00:11:57.813 --> 00:11:59.484
and return my stuff to me.

237
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:02.854
Lawyer Lee Young Ho.

238
00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:04.724
Is it illegal for an owner...

239
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.183
to take his things back?

240
00:12:06.624 --> 00:12:09.494
There is no problem.

241
00:12:12.994 --> 00:12:14.394
Give me...

242
00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:17.333
the original black box.

243
00:12:25.543 --> 00:12:26.673
Mr. Choi.

244
00:12:27.573 --> 00:12:28.774
Thank you.

245
00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:30.573
Good work.

246
00:12:46.163 --> 00:12:48.333
(Mad Dog: Show)

247
00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:51.703
I heard your son woke up.

248
00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.364
That's good news.

249
00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:55.104
Goodness.

250
00:12:56.073 --> 00:12:59.173
I never thought you'd ask...

251
00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:00.703
about him first.

252
00:13:02.244 --> 00:13:06.183
I heard he rained on someone's parade.

253
00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:08.953
Rain stops after sometime.

254
00:13:08.953 --> 00:13:11.124
I handed over what your daughter wanted,

255
00:13:11.754 --> 00:13:13.683
so I'll take what was promised.

256
00:13:15.793 --> 00:13:18.163
Are you talking about the time when you...

257
00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:19.464
pressured Ministry of Land and Transport...

258
00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:22.134
to increase JH Group's number of flights?

259
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.264
I'll erase it clean...

260
00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:26.234
for your son's sake.

261
00:13:26.403 --> 00:13:31.104
Get rid of 801 completely.

262
00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:33.943
It's too good to just get rid of.

263
00:13:34.943 --> 00:13:36.514
It could be the wings...

264
00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:39.443
to take you to the Blue House.

265
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:41.283
We shouldn't get rid of it.

266
00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:44.754
There are too many risk factors.

267
00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.083
Joo Hyun Ki...

268
00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:49.754
is furious.

269
00:13:50.024 --> 00:13:52.163
Send him away.

270
00:13:52.323 --> 00:13:53.764
You can enter...

271
00:13:53.764 --> 00:13:57.134
the Blue House after getting rid of him.

272
00:14:05.903 --> 00:14:06.943
Yes.

273
00:14:09.043 --> 00:14:10.173
Okay.

274
00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:13.214
Goodness.

275
00:14:14.884 --> 00:14:16.453
It looks like...

276
00:14:17.254 --> 00:14:19.083
you'll get sent away first.

277
00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:24.693
(Young Ho)

278
00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:28.163
Answer it.

279
00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:31.703
What's the matter?

280
00:14:47.984 --> 00:14:49.053
Any news of Noo Ri?

281
00:14:49.453 --> 00:14:50.913
He was moved to a different hospital.

282
00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:52.254
But I don't know which one...

283
00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:55.024
Nurse Oh said she'd find out.

284
00:14:55.524 --> 00:14:57.453
I asked my friends to look into it.

285
00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:01.234
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

286
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.634
Why is that because of you?

287
00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.163
It's not like that.

288
00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.374
It's nice to meet you.

289
00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:12.303
I'm the brother of Juhan Air Flight 801's...

290
00:15:12.374 --> 00:15:13.844
co-pilot, Kim Bum Joon.

291
00:15:14.203 --> 00:15:15.344
I'm Kim Min Joon.

292
00:15:15.344 --> 00:15:16.413
There was a press interview...

293
00:15:16.413 --> 00:15:18.943
of the brother of Juhan Air Flight 801's...

294
00:15:18.943 --> 00:15:21.413
co-pilot Kim Bum Joon at 11am today.

295
00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.153
Mr. Kim was expected to...

296
00:15:23.153 --> 00:15:25.183
raise suspicion regarding...

297
00:15:25.183 --> 00:15:27.524
the crash of the JH Flight 801,

298
00:15:27.524 --> 00:15:29.823
but the press interview was interrupted...

299
00:15:29.823 --> 00:15:32.323
suddenly by a victim's family.

300
00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:33.894
Mr. Kim has protested...

301
00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:35.734
in front of JH head office...

302
00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:38.364
that his brother's death was...

303
00:15:38.364 --> 00:15:40.734
an industrial accident,

304
00:15:40.734 --> 00:15:42.874
and he was denounced by public outcry.

305
00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:44.744
Next news...

306
00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:47.274
Ma'am. I'm going to change the channel.

307
00:15:47.274 --> 00:15:49.043
An unknown donor...

308
00:15:49.043 --> 00:15:51.543
donated 100,000 dollars to a charity.

309
00:15:52.014 --> 00:15:54.614
You know the co-pilot had 3.4-million payout.

310
00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:57.384
He's doing that after getting all the money.

311
00:15:57.384 --> 00:15:59.823
He went to JH to threaten them...

312
00:15:59.953 --> 00:16:02.394
to get more money, not to protest.

313
00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:05.663
I heard he was adopted and sent to Germany,

314
00:16:05.663 --> 00:16:07.494
and he was a delinquent there.

315
00:16:07.964 --> 00:16:10.833
Those brothers are both crazy.

316
00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:16.203
That's not true.

317
00:16:16.974 --> 00:16:18.043
So don't mind them.

318
00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.203
It is true.

319
00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:22.144
I am a scammer.

320
00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:25.384
I scammed you.

321
00:16:30.014 --> 00:16:31.153
What are you looking at?

322
00:16:31.754 --> 00:16:33.183
Just keep drinking.

323
00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:43.464
Soju tastes bitter.

324
00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:45.403
I'll get going first.

325
00:16:45.403 --> 00:16:46.433
Mr. Kim.

326
00:16:47.403 --> 00:16:48.474
Eat before you leave.

327
00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.333
I'm tired. I'll go to sleep.

328
00:17:14.863 --> 00:17:16.533
Mayday, mayday.

329
00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:19.164
Jeju Tower, respond!

330
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.734
Mayday, mayday.

331
00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:23.033
What's going on?

332
00:17:23.033 --> 00:17:25.643
Jeju Tower, respond!

333
00:17:26.404 --> 00:17:28.043
Pull up. Go around!

334
00:17:28.043 --> 00:17:29.744
Pull up!

335
00:17:33.543 --> 00:17:34.613
Bum Joon.

336
00:17:35.514 --> 00:17:36.654
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.883
I ruined everything.

338
00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.164
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.704
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:10.053 --> 00:18:12.224
I know you got the black box footage from Mr. Choi.

341
00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:13.823
Give it to me.

342
00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:15.893
Mr. Choi...

343
00:18:16.694 --> 00:18:18.593
did something terrible.

344
00:18:19.123 --> 00:18:21.293
He used a delusional man as his pawn...

345
00:18:21.293 --> 00:18:22.793
to hold a press conference.

346
00:18:23.234 --> 00:18:25.363
Then he fabricated the proof of a tragedy...

347
00:18:25.603 --> 00:18:28.373
in which over 190 people died or got hurt.

348
00:18:28.934 --> 00:18:30.133
Cha Hong Joo...

349
00:18:45.553 --> 00:18:47.154
You're here, Hong Joo.

350
00:18:47.283 --> 00:18:48.353
You didn't answer my calls.

351
00:18:48.353 --> 00:18:50.254
You didn't answer my calls either...

352
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.694
until this afternoon.

353
00:18:51.694 --> 00:18:52.694
Have a seat.

354
00:18:54.024 --> 00:18:55.033
Still,

355
00:18:55.793 --> 00:18:57.393
I prepared a glass...

356
00:18:57.393 --> 00:18:58.504
and waited for you.

357
00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:01.033
- Mr. Joo. - I said, sit down.

358
00:19:07.303 --> 00:19:08.343
Mr. Joo.

359
00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:09.774
Hong Joo.

360
00:19:09.944 --> 00:19:11.414
It's Hyun Ki.

361
00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:13.484
It's time you call me by my name.

362
00:19:14.244 --> 00:19:15.553
Especially today,

363
00:19:15.714 --> 00:19:18.053
I'd like you to call me by my name.

364
00:19:20.984 --> 00:19:21.994
Never mind.

365
00:19:22.754 --> 00:19:24.224
That was too much like a loser.

366
00:19:24.994 --> 00:19:27.964
It's not right to force you to call me that way...

367
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.533
because I know your weakness.

368
00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:31.164
My bad.

369
00:19:31.434 --> 00:19:33.333
Until when will you pretend?

370
00:19:33.904 --> 00:19:35.204
That's enough.

371
00:19:37.373 --> 00:19:39.404
Me? Pretend to what?

372
00:19:39.873 --> 00:19:41.573
Pretending to be foolish.

373
00:19:41.774 --> 00:19:43.174
I know you're acting like a fool.

374
00:19:43.613 --> 00:19:45.383
Stop it now, Mr. Joo.

375
00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:49.684
Shall I?

376
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.623
Shall I, Hong Joo?

377
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:01.533
Then I should stop this too.

378
00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:04.704
Pretending to like you.

379
00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:09.674
I...

380
00:20:10.274 --> 00:20:11.404
think...

381
00:20:12.073 --> 00:20:14.073
I do like you though.

382
00:20:16.113 --> 00:20:17.474
When I found out...

383
00:20:17.474 --> 00:20:19.883
that you gave my stuff to Choi Kang Woo,

384
00:20:20.444 --> 00:20:21.783
I realized it.

385
00:20:22.283 --> 00:20:24.553
I didn't hate you or feel resentful,

386
00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:25.783
but my heart...

387
00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:29.994
My heart ached so much.

388
00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:33.593
I thought I must be crazy.

389
00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.633
And...

390
00:20:37.704 --> 00:20:40.234
I slapped my cheek several times that night.

391
00:20:40.234 --> 00:20:42.204
That's enough. Don't say any more.

392
00:20:43.004 --> 00:20:45.603
I'm not here to listen to such stuff.

393
00:20:45.873 --> 00:20:47.204
It's not time for that.

394
00:20:47.603 --> 00:20:49.873
It is, Hong Joo.

395
00:20:50.244 --> 00:20:51.883
Because I like you,

396
00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.914
I want to give your father a chance.

397
00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:56.184
What chance?

398
00:20:56.184 --> 00:20:57.514
A chance to confess.

399
00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:00.684
Confess what?

400
00:21:00.684 --> 00:21:03.793
To the murder. Your father killed my father.

401
00:21:15.704 --> 00:21:18.143
What brings you here at this hour?

402
00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:20.843
What are you doing here...

403
00:21:23.914 --> 00:21:25.244
until this late at night?

404
00:21:25.643 --> 00:21:27.313
There are bugs,

405
00:21:27.343 --> 00:21:28.754
so I'm spraying pesticides on the trees.

406
00:21:40.363 --> 00:21:41.764
It was around here, right?

407
00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:44.533
Where Chairman Joo...

408
00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:46.633
collapsed two years ago.

409
00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.474
Do you have...

410
00:21:53.944 --> 00:21:55.174
anything...

411
00:21:56.573 --> 00:21:58.083
to do with his death?

412
00:21:58.813 --> 00:21:59.843
Hong Joo.

413
00:22:01.484 --> 00:22:02.514
Do you...

414
00:22:03.053 --> 00:22:04.454
remember this tree?

415
00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.123
Your mother...

416
00:22:07.383 --> 00:22:09.524
picked this up on a street,

417
00:22:09.754 --> 00:22:12.363
and it grew this tall.

418
00:22:15.694 --> 00:22:16.934
You hated it...

419
00:22:16.934 --> 00:22:18.333
because she got what someone else threw out.

420
00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:20.363
I thought you got rid of it.

421
00:22:27.643 --> 00:22:30.873
She said I wasn't the Cha Joon Kyu from...

422
00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.014
the shantytown,

423
00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:35.914
rejecting all those good trees...

424
00:22:35.914 --> 00:22:37.083
imported from abroad.

425
00:22:37.383 --> 00:22:40.224
She said she owned only two things...

426
00:22:40.553 --> 00:22:43.924
in this palace-like house.

427
00:22:44.323 --> 00:22:45.524
She thought...

428
00:22:46.424 --> 00:22:47.863
only you and this tree...

429
00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:50.633
were hers.

430
00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:56.033
Dad.

431
00:22:56.873 --> 00:22:58.474
Jung Pil, that punk,

432
00:22:59.474 --> 00:23:00.573
kicked...

433
00:23:01.373 --> 00:23:05.843
this tree with his foot.

434
00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:09.184
Thank you for the 30 million dollars...

435
00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:11.154
last time.

436
00:23:11.524 --> 00:23:13.083
I'm sorry,

437
00:23:13.454 --> 00:23:16.823
but I'd like you to lend me about 10 million more.

438
00:23:17.553 --> 00:23:18.664
You can do that, right?

439
00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:22.964
He took my 30 million and played innocent.

440
00:23:23.133 --> 00:23:24.603
He wanted 10 million more.

441
00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:27.004
He came to borrow money,

442
00:23:27.563 --> 00:23:28.573
but he kicked...

443
00:23:29.704 --> 00:23:31.674
the tree shamelessly.

444
00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:35.714
I held it in. I really did.

445
00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:39.684
I think my son likes your daughter.

446
00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:42.154
And Hong Joo, that punk...

447
00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:44.553
mentioned about you.

448
00:23:45.154 --> 00:23:46.323
That his son,

449
00:23:46.954 --> 00:23:48.893
the despicable scum,

450
00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:51.323
liked you.

451
00:23:51.623 --> 00:23:55.593
That the daughter of a man...

452
00:23:55.593 --> 00:23:57.833
from the shantytown dared seduce the man...

453
00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:00.004
from a family that'd been rich from generations.

454
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:02.033
He said...

455
00:24:02.533 --> 00:24:05.674
I should consider the 10 million dollars...

456
00:24:05.674 --> 00:24:07.674
as a dowry for him to accept you in his family.

457
00:24:10.613 --> 00:24:11.613
So...

458
00:24:12.944 --> 00:24:14.313
what did you do?

459
00:24:14.883 --> 00:24:16.283
I sprayed pesticides...

460
00:24:17.783 --> 00:24:19.024
on an insect.

461
00:24:22.654 --> 00:24:25.964
Hey, you...

462
00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.893
Whenever he talked to me,

463
00:24:58.024 --> 00:25:00.123
he brought up that shantytown.

464
00:25:01.593 --> 00:25:03.464
He said one's origin couldn't be helped.

465
00:25:03.994 --> 00:25:07.704
I wonder how his face will change...

466
00:25:07.904 --> 00:25:10.073
if the man from the shantytown takes over JH.

467
00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:13.244
I can't wait to see it in the afterlife.

468
00:25:15.073 --> 00:25:17.514
Joo Hyun Ki knows it all.

469
00:25:18.014 --> 00:25:19.113
Everything.

470
00:25:20.444 --> 00:25:22.454
He wants to give you a chance...

471
00:25:24.254 --> 00:25:25.583
to confess your sin.

472
00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:27.254
Did you...

473
00:25:28.654 --> 00:25:30.694
hear it from him and came to see me?

474
00:25:32.524 --> 00:25:34.893
So that's what he wanted.

475
00:25:35.293 --> 00:25:37.494
He wanted to put us apart.

476
00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:40.704
So...

477
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.904
what do you think?

478
00:25:43.974 --> 00:25:45.004
Are you...

479
00:25:45.573 --> 00:25:46.803
disappointed in me?

480
00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:49.113
Should I...

481
00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:51.043
confess?

482
00:25:54.113 --> 00:25:55.113
No.

483
00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:00.724
Don't even think about it.

484
00:26:03.323 --> 00:26:06.563
I'm sorry I'm calling you at this hour, Chief On.

485
00:26:07.363 --> 00:26:08.694
It's urgent.

486
00:26:09.293 --> 00:26:10.363
(Vice President)

487
00:26:18.573 --> 00:26:20.543
The legal affairs manager urgently wants to...

488
00:26:24.484 --> 00:26:25.883
What's the matter?

489
00:26:25.883 --> 00:26:27.714
People from Special Investigation Team Two...

490
00:26:27.714 --> 00:26:30.113
are coming upstairs with a confiscation warrant.

491
00:26:30.254 --> 00:26:31.254
What?

492
00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.123
Close the doors, Secretary Han.

493
00:26:33.654 --> 00:26:34.654
Stop them.

494
00:26:37.454 --> 00:26:39.623
What are you doing? Clean out already.

495
00:26:39.623 --> 00:26:40.694
Yes, sir.

496
00:27:03.553 --> 00:27:04.684
Gosh.

497
00:27:07.454 --> 00:27:09.494
Stop it now. If you don't,

498
00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:11.494
we'll arrest you for destroying evidence.

499
00:27:11.494 --> 00:27:13.464
My expensive laptop is broken.

500
00:27:14.024 --> 00:27:15.533
I'm just upset.

501
00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:17.764
We're from Special Investigation Team Two.

502
00:27:18.264 --> 00:27:20.204
We'll start...

503
00:27:20.204 --> 00:27:23.033
searching and seizing your office...

504
00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:25.004
for embezzlement and malpractice.

505
00:27:25.803 --> 00:27:26.843
Go ahead.

506
00:27:29.313 --> 00:27:30.543
Search every corner.

507
00:27:30.543 --> 00:27:31.583
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

508
00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.484
Search everywhere.

509
00:27:33.484 --> 00:27:35.353
- This way. - Here.

510
00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:36.484
Okay, sir.

511
00:27:36.684 --> 00:27:39.283
- Seize everything. - Yes, sir.

512
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.494
Don't miss anything.

513
00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:42.494
Yes, sir.

514
00:27:43.994 --> 00:27:45.164
Pack these.

515
00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:46.164
Yes, sir.

516
00:27:47.464 --> 00:27:48.793
Let's hurry up.

517
00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:50.063
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

518
00:27:51.533 --> 00:27:54.033
I didn't think you'd come to me right away.

519
00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:55.934
Shouldn't you go home?

520
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:57.974
It must be a mess over there.

521
00:28:01.944 --> 00:28:03.573
You asked the prosecutors...

522
00:28:03.573 --> 00:28:06.583
to find the insurance and the black box.

523
00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:09.754
You betrayed me.

524
00:28:10.113 --> 00:28:11.323
Cha Hong Joo.

525
00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.293
I am...

526
00:28:19.393 --> 00:28:21.093
quite hurt.

527
00:28:21.434 --> 00:28:24.194
Is that so? That's good.

528
00:28:26.633 --> 00:28:29.174
It's about time that you got hurt.

529
00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:31.244
It can't always be me.

530
00:28:31.244 --> 00:28:32.303
What?

531
00:28:33.573 --> 00:28:36.313
JH801, Choi Kang Woo.

532
00:28:36.843 --> 00:28:38.684
You even brought up my father.

533
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:42.714
You kept agitating me.

534
00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.424
That's because...

535
00:28:44.954 --> 00:28:47.454
I was frustrated that you had no clue.

536
00:28:47.454 --> 00:28:48.524
No.

537
00:28:48.524 --> 00:28:51.123
It's a bad habit of an immature person.

538
00:28:54.434 --> 00:28:55.833
It's because I liked you.

539
00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:57.533
How dare you...

540
00:28:57.803 --> 00:28:59.264
say that?

541
00:29:01.833 --> 00:29:03.204
(Taeyang Insurance)

542
00:29:03.234 --> 00:29:04.504
Mr. Joo.

543
00:29:06.073 --> 00:29:10.214
I detest you and your family...

544
00:29:10.214 --> 00:29:11.944
to death.

545
00:29:13.283 --> 00:29:15.383
Shall I tell you how much I detest you?

546
00:29:20.123 --> 00:29:22.323
I'll hold a special meeting with stockholders.

547
00:29:22.323 --> 00:29:23.754
You can be arrested for embezzlement,

548
00:29:23.754 --> 00:29:25.863
and the management can be arrested anytime.

549
00:29:25.863 --> 00:29:27.464
We should do something about it.

550
00:29:32.934 --> 00:29:35.873
You came up with a great plot, Hong Joo.

551
00:29:36.504 --> 00:29:37.774
Good job.

552
00:29:38.873 --> 00:29:40.603
Don't compliment me.

553
00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:43.613
Leave.

554
00:29:44.914 --> 00:29:47.684
Okay, I'm leaving.

555
00:29:50.954 --> 00:29:52.484
Don't try to stop me.

556
00:30:03.793 --> 00:30:05.103
Chief On.

557
00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.464
You pressured the Department...

558
00:30:07.464 --> 00:30:09.873
of Transport to let JH air increase their flights.

559
00:30:09.873 --> 00:30:11.543
I can erase the record for you.

560
00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:14.073
If you do that, what will you take in return?

561
00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:16.214
Mr. Choi gave you the black box, right?

562
00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:17.543
Give that to me.

563
00:30:17.883 --> 00:30:21.613
Mr. Choi did something terrible.

564
00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:23.883
He used a delusional man as his pawn...

565
00:30:23.883 --> 00:30:25.454
to hold a press conference.

566
00:30:25.454 --> 00:30:27.553
Then he fabricated the proof of a tragedy...

567
00:30:27.754 --> 00:30:30.424
in which over 190 people died or got hurt.

568
00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:33.724
Gosh, Hong Joo is impressive.

569
00:30:33.724 --> 00:30:35.863
She's very impressive.

570
00:30:36.964 --> 00:30:38.063
Today at 11am,

571
00:30:38.063 --> 00:30:39.964
Seoul Prosecutors' Office Special Team Two...

572
00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:42.033
seized and searched the main office and house...

573
00:30:42.033 --> 00:30:43.974
of JH Group Vice President Joo Hyun Ki.

574
00:30:43.974 --> 00:30:46.073
It was to investigate the matters...

575
00:30:46.073 --> 00:30:48.214
related to embezzlement.

576
00:30:48.214 --> 00:30:50.043
With the help of detectives,

577
00:30:50.043 --> 00:30:52.744
the prosecutors found Mr. Joo's personal...

578
00:30:52.744 --> 00:30:55.613
notes, accounting records, and hard disks.

579
00:30:55.883 --> 00:30:57.853
The prosecutors will change Mr. Joo's...

580
00:30:57.853 --> 00:31:00.654
status as a suspect for investigation.

581
00:31:00.654 --> 00:31:02.454
Prosecutors' Office Special Team Two...

582
00:31:02.454 --> 00:31:04.123
works for Chief On, right?

583
00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:05.524
Chief On is onto something.

584
00:31:05.524 --> 00:31:07.793
Did they even search the vice president's home?

585
00:31:07.793 --> 00:31:09.333
They're searching for...

586
00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:10.764
the insurance contract and black box.

587
00:31:10.764 --> 00:31:12.803
Chairman Cha is thorough.

588
00:31:12.803 --> 00:31:13.833
No.

589
00:31:14.504 --> 00:31:16.204
Cha Hong Joo is behind this.

590
00:31:16.803 --> 00:31:18.504
The Insurance, black box...

591
00:31:18.504 --> 00:31:20.103
and management of JH Group.

592
00:31:20.103 --> 00:31:22.414
She's definitely after Joo Hyun Ki.

593
00:31:22.873 --> 00:31:25.313
Chairman Cha targets surrounding people first.

594
00:31:25.914 --> 00:31:28.583
He uses the pain of losing someone...

595
00:31:28.914 --> 00:31:31.254
and gets what he wants.

596
00:31:31.254 --> 00:31:33.754
That's why he was after Mr. Kim.

597
00:31:34.694 --> 00:31:36.424
Besides, Mr. Choi pays...

598
00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.593
most of his attention to Mr. Kim.

599
00:31:38.593 --> 00:31:40.694
- What? - That's nonsense.

600
00:31:40.694 --> 00:31:41.893
That's enough.

601
00:31:41.893 --> 00:31:43.764
What shall we do, Mr. Choi?

602
00:31:48.504 --> 00:31:49.674
Mad Dog...

603
00:31:50.404 --> 00:31:52.603
will disband.

604
00:31:52.603 --> 00:31:53.643
- What? - Mr. Choi.

605
00:31:53.643 --> 00:31:54.944
Mr. Choi Kang Woo.

606
00:31:57.643 --> 00:31:59.343
The JH Group stockholder meeting...

607
00:31:59.343 --> 00:32:00.843
is scheduled after six weeks.

608
00:32:01.654 --> 00:32:02.853
Good job.

609
00:32:02.853 --> 00:32:04.014
(Few days later)

610
00:32:04.424 --> 00:32:05.883
What about Joo Hyun Ki?

611
00:32:06.123 --> 00:32:07.623
With legal affairs team,

612
00:32:07.623 --> 00:32:10.454
he's doing everything to evade the problem.

613
00:32:11.924 --> 00:32:13.123
Choi Kang Woo.

614
00:32:14.093 --> 00:32:15.593
What's Mad Dog up to?

615
00:32:15.593 --> 00:32:17.664
They've disbanded.

616
00:32:17.664 --> 00:32:19.363
They did?

617
00:32:19.764 --> 00:32:21.033
Mad Dog disbanded?

618
00:32:21.033 --> 00:32:22.234
Choi Kang Woo...

619
00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:24.504
gave the order to disband.

620
00:32:33.244 --> 00:32:35.283
Come on.

621
00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:37.353
We can't disband Mad Dog.

622
00:32:37.654 --> 00:32:40.823
Of course I'm scared too.

623
00:32:40.823 --> 00:32:42.893
Cha Joon Kyu, Cha Hong Joo.

624
00:32:43.524 --> 00:32:47.024
When I saw them messing with Joo Hyun Ki,

625
00:32:47.024 --> 00:32:48.333
I feel...

626
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:49.694
That's good.

627
00:32:50.563 --> 00:32:51.964
Let's stop it.

628
00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.234
Let's quit.

629
00:32:54.234 --> 00:32:55.504
Min Joon.

630
00:32:55.504 --> 00:32:58.504
Who are you to tell me to quit?

631
00:32:58.504 --> 00:32:59.944
What else can we do?

632
00:33:00.303 --> 00:33:03.414
You're trembling with fear.

633
00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.444
What?

634
00:33:04.744 --> 00:33:07.283
You're only a kid.

635
00:33:07.283 --> 00:33:08.484
Forget it.

636
00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:12.024
I'm sick of Korea.

637
00:33:12.024 --> 00:33:14.224
Then you should leave.

638
00:33:15.053 --> 00:33:16.424
1 by 1,

639
00:33:16.424 --> 00:33:18.393
people start to look away.

640
00:33:18.393 --> 00:33:19.793
Innocent people...

641
00:33:19.793 --> 00:33:21.593
get hurt or die.

642
00:33:21.593 --> 00:33:24.264
Then they blame it all on my brother.

643
00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:27.033
What kind of country is this?

644
00:33:27.033 --> 00:33:29.373
Are you going to run away?

645
00:33:30.803 --> 00:33:33.073
All of us got involved because of you.

646
00:33:33.073 --> 00:33:34.974
Don't you care...

647
00:33:34.974 --> 00:33:35.974
what happens to us?

648
00:33:35.974 --> 00:33:37.674
You got involved because of me?

649
00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:39.514
That's not true.

650
00:33:39.514 --> 00:33:41.853
You decided to get involved...

651
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.053
because you trusted him.

652
00:33:44.553 --> 00:33:47.224
Blame yourself for making the decision.

653
00:33:47.793 --> 00:33:50.093
Demand Mr. Choi to take responsibility.

654
00:33:52.194 --> 00:33:55.133
I can't hold it any longer.

655
00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.194
How dare you blame him?

656
00:33:57.194 --> 00:33:58.404
Hey, you.

657
00:33:58.563 --> 00:34:01.974
You can't blame him for this.

658
00:34:02.504 --> 00:34:03.803
Park Soon Jung.

659
00:34:04.803 --> 00:34:07.103
Are you sure nothing is wrong with you?

660
00:34:07.103 --> 00:34:08.714
You always obey...

661
00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:10.674
everything that he says.

662
00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:13.214
I shouldn't blame him?

663
00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:14.884
He's not responsible?

664
00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:17.384
Act your age.

665
00:34:17.384 --> 00:34:19.054
You punk.

666
00:34:19.054 --> 00:34:22.393
You're about to hit me. I'm scared.

667
00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:24.563
Fine, it's all my fault.

668
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:27.223
It's my fault, and I'm responsible.

669
00:34:27.623 --> 00:34:29.563
Keep being blind.

670
00:34:29.563 --> 00:34:31.234
Keep living that way for your whole life.

671
00:34:31.234 --> 00:34:32.304
You punk.

672
00:34:36.603 --> 00:34:38.373
- Why you... - Park Soon Jung.

673
00:34:38.973 --> 00:34:41.574
What are you doing?

674
00:34:41.574 --> 00:34:43.513
Come to your senses.

675
00:34:43.513 --> 00:34:44.944
Don't fall for him...

676
00:34:44.944 --> 00:34:46.844
and be fickle all the time.

677
00:34:46.844 --> 00:34:49.453
Stay focused.

678
00:34:49.453 --> 00:34:51.884
What? You're out of your mind.

679
00:34:52.554 --> 00:34:54.924
Darn it.

680
00:34:54.924 --> 00:34:56.993
Lower your eyes now.

681
00:34:56.993 --> 00:35:00.393
Goodness. Get lost.

682
00:35:00.524 --> 00:35:02.163
Darn it.

683
00:35:03.893 --> 00:35:04.964
Hey.

684
00:35:05.964 --> 00:35:07.333
Come here.

685
00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:09.703
You punk.

686
00:35:09.904 --> 00:35:11.774
How dare you punch me?

687
00:35:13.574 --> 00:35:15.143
You annoying brat.

688
00:35:15.143 --> 00:35:17.043
I just always...

689
00:35:17.043 --> 00:35:19.543
wanted to knock you out.

690
00:35:19.543 --> 00:35:20.884
You punk.

691
00:35:21.654 --> 00:35:22.884
Hit me.

692
00:35:22.884 --> 00:35:24.723
Stop, that hurts.

693
00:35:24.723 --> 00:35:26.223
How dare you hit me?

694
00:35:26.623 --> 00:35:29.853
Goodness, please stop them.

695
00:35:37.293 --> 00:35:38.404
How dare you?

696
00:35:39.063 --> 00:35:40.433
Stop!

697
00:35:42.873 --> 00:35:43.904
Get lost.

698
00:35:43.904 --> 00:35:45.004
Mr. Choi.

699
00:35:45.373 --> 00:35:47.473
- Mr. Choi. - We're going to stop.

700
00:35:48.774 --> 00:35:50.043
So get lost!

701
00:35:53.583 --> 00:35:55.554
Come here.

702
00:35:55.583 --> 00:35:57.353
How dare you?

703
00:35:58.683 --> 00:36:00.054
How can I believe this?

704
00:36:00.754 --> 00:36:02.353
Where's Choi Kang Woo?

705
00:36:02.654 --> 00:36:04.353
What is he up to now?

706
00:36:04.353 --> 00:36:06.223
He travels to fishing spots.

707
00:36:06.223 --> 00:36:07.734
He's fishing.

708
00:36:07.734 --> 00:36:08.763
Fishing?

709
00:36:20.703 --> 00:36:22.143
Jan Gebauer.

710
00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:25.214
What about Kim Min Joon?

711
00:36:25.214 --> 00:36:26.513
Kim Min Joon...

712
00:36:26.513 --> 00:36:28.913
spends time with people at bars.

713
00:36:28.913 --> 00:36:30.083
Either he drinks...

714
00:36:30.083 --> 00:36:31.353
or seduces women.

715
00:36:32.054 --> 00:36:33.824
He's drunk every night.

716
00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:37.453
Any good clubs in Seoul?

717
00:36:37.453 --> 00:36:39.663
There's so many.

718
00:36:41.734 --> 00:36:42.993
Girls will dig you.

719
00:36:43.393 --> 00:36:46.034
Do you want to join and hang out with us tonight?

720
00:36:47.634 --> 00:36:48.904
This is on me.

721
00:36:49.603 --> 00:36:51.274
- Shall we go now? - Sure.

722
00:36:51.274 --> 00:36:52.844
Sure. Hey.

723
00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:04.284
Thank you.

724
00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:27.404
What about Jang Ha Ri?

725
00:37:28.274 --> 00:37:30.844
She repairs cars at a friend's garage.

726
00:37:35.984 --> 00:37:37.353
The battery looks fine.

727
00:37:42.324 --> 00:37:44.353
The car makes noise because...

728
00:37:44.353 --> 00:37:46.893
of the engine belt problem.

729
00:37:47.293 --> 00:37:48.763
Do you see how it's cracked?

730
00:37:48.763 --> 00:37:50.663
- Yes. - And...

731
00:37:51.734 --> 00:37:53.203
You should...

732
00:37:53.203 --> 00:37:55.103
change the bearings too.

733
00:37:55.103 --> 00:37:56.904
Okay. Please do that.

734
00:37:57.333 --> 00:37:58.904
Okay, sir.

735
00:37:58.904 --> 00:37:59.904
Thank you.

736
00:38:00.043 --> 00:38:02.243
Her dad used to run a garage.

737
00:38:03.373 --> 00:38:05.913
What about Park Soon Jung?

738
00:38:06.243 --> 00:38:08.853
He got a job as a nurse at a hospital.

739
00:38:09.513 --> 00:38:10.513
Hello.

740
00:38:11.784 --> 00:38:12.953
Hi.

741
00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:14.723
Gosh.

742
00:38:14.723 --> 00:38:16.324
He looks like an abalone.

743
00:38:16.324 --> 00:38:17.453
Hey.

744
00:38:17.694 --> 00:38:18.893
Please forgive her.

745
00:38:18.893 --> 00:38:21.263
I'm sorry, sir.

746
00:38:21.263 --> 00:38:22.993
It's okay.

747
00:38:24.404 --> 00:38:25.404
Abalone?

748
00:38:25.734 --> 00:38:27.873
They must be up to something.

749
00:38:28.304 --> 00:38:30.833
Have our people watch them and...

750
00:38:32.004 --> 00:38:33.504
(Chief On Joo Sik)

751
00:38:34.873 --> 00:38:35.973
Wait a minute.

752
00:38:38.844 --> 00:38:40.114
Yes, Chief On.

753
00:38:40.114 --> 00:38:41.384
Director Cha.

754
00:38:42.313 --> 00:38:44.384
How are you taking care of things?

755
00:38:44.384 --> 00:38:46.353
What do you mean?

756
00:38:46.353 --> 00:38:48.393
The insurance and black box are...

757
00:38:48.953 --> 00:38:50.424
nowhere to be found.

758
00:38:51.563 --> 00:38:52.993
I don't think they exist.

759
00:38:52.993 --> 00:38:55.594
It's just words.

760
00:38:56.194 --> 00:38:59.433
I'll have to think again about this.

761
00:39:00.534 --> 00:39:01.734
I'm sorry.

762
00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:04.844
I'll make sure...

763
00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.373
What's the problem, ma'am?

764
00:39:10.373 --> 00:39:11.714
The insurance and black box are...

765
00:39:12.284 --> 00:39:14.754
in Hyun Ki's hands.

766
00:39:15.083 --> 00:39:16.384
I'll find them, ma'am.

768
00:39:40.603 --> 00:39:41.743
Manager Lee.

769
00:39:42.074 --> 00:39:43.313
What brings you here?

770
00:39:44.683 --> 00:39:46.243
Are you here to see the vice president?

771
00:39:46.243 --> 00:39:48.614
No. I'm here to see you.

772
00:39:49.183 --> 00:39:51.013
I have something...

773
00:39:51.453 --> 00:39:53.424
I want to ask you.

774
00:39:53.654 --> 00:39:54.654
Ask me?

775
00:39:55.324 --> 00:39:56.324
About what?

776
00:39:59.763 --> 00:40:01.634
Look who it is.

777
00:40:01.993 --> 00:40:02.993
Sir.

778
00:40:03.763 --> 00:40:05.364
It's JH's previous legal affairs manager,

779
00:40:05.364 --> 00:40:07.163
and Taeyang's current legal affairs manager,

780

Lee Young Ho.

781
00:40:09.234 --> 00:40:10.634
We meet again, Vice President Joo.

782
00:40:11.143 --> 00:40:14.373
Right. I keep bumping into you unexpectedly.

783
00:40:14.743 --> 00:40:17.174
Police station. JH building.

784
00:40:17.944 --> 00:40:19.413
Why are you here today?

785
00:40:19.743 --> 00:40:21.183
I was...

786
00:40:22.183 --> 00:40:24.353
I was happy to see Mr. Han.

787
00:40:24.353 --> 00:40:25.884
I see.

788
00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:27.284
Don't be happy to see him.

789
00:40:27.284 --> 00:40:28.654
He's my secretary.

790
00:40:36.594 --> 00:40:39.663
Quickly go back to...

791
00:40:41.103 --> 00:40:44.203
the burning Taeyang,

792
00:40:45.203 --> 00:40:46.243
Mr. Lee Young Ho.

793
00:40:49.074 --> 00:40:50.214
See you next time.

794
00:40:57.313 --> 00:40:58.353
Secretary Han.

795
00:41:13.063 --> 00:41:14.163
Mad Dog...

796
00:41:14.703 --> 00:41:15.703
will...

797
00:41:16.333 --> 00:41:17.873
- disband. - What?

798
00:41:17.873 --> 00:41:19.344
- Kang Woo. - Mr. Choi.

799
00:41:19.574 --> 00:41:20.703
We'll disband.

800
00:41:21.973 --> 00:41:23.844
You'll disperse their attention.

801
00:41:24.043 --> 00:41:25.884
Then I'll get a bait.

802
00:41:28.284 --> 00:41:30.784
Will they believe that we disbanded?

803
00:41:30.784 --> 00:41:34.554
First, we'll start a dog fight.

804
00:41:36.054 --> 00:41:40.424
Hey. I'll kill you, punk.

805
00:41:40.864 --> 00:41:42.594
How dare you hit my face!

806
00:41:42.594 --> 00:41:44.404
You punk.

807
00:41:44.404 --> 00:41:47.234
Die, you stupid punk.

808
00:41:47.703 --> 00:41:49.203
Try me.

809
00:41:49.203 --> 00:41:51.243
Hey.

810
00:41:51.243 --> 00:41:52.603
How dare you!

811
00:41:52.603 --> 00:41:55.143
Come here.

812
00:41:56.913 --> 00:41:59.083
Hey!

813
00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.413
- How dare you! - Why you...

814
00:42:01.413 --> 00:42:02.413
Stop!

815
00:42:02.413 --> 00:42:04.554

816
00:42:07.154 --> 00:42:09.353
- Get lost. - Mr. Choi.

817
00:42:09.353 --> 00:42:10.993
Kang Woo.

818
00:42:10.993 --> 00:42:12.464
I won't do this anymore.

819
00:42:13.663 --> 00:42:14.864
So get lost!

820
00:42:17.864 --> 00:42:19.504
Well...

821
00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:21.234

00:42:23.473 --> 00:42:26.143
What are you looking at? Bloodsucker.

823
00:42:27.404 --> 00:42:28.973
There.

824
00:42:30.574 --> 00:42:32.944
What about after the dog fight?

825
00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.654
Soon Jung will get a job as a nurse.

826
00:42:34.654 --> 00:42:36.183
What? Which hospital?

827
00:42:36.183 --> 00:42:37.284
Noo Ri is there.

828
00:42:37.654 --> 00:42:39.183
(Kanghae Hospital)

829
00:42:39.953 --> 00:42:40.953

Gosh.

832
00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:46.663
He looks like an abalone.

833
00:42:46.663 --> 00:42:49.194
Hey. Please forgive her.

834
00:42:49.194 --> 00:42:51.504
I'm sorry, sir.

835
00:42:51.603 --> 00:42:53.203
It's okay.

836
00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:54.203

00:43:04.743 --> 00:43:06.313
1301.

838
00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:09.254
- What about me? - Work at a garage.

839
00:43:11.013 --> 00:43:13.123
This place is owned by someone you know, right?

840
00:43:13.853 --> 00:43:15.194
It's run by the vice president...

841
00:43:15.194 --> 00:43:16.654
of my car club.

842
00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:18.763
Ms. Jang is the president.

843
00:43:19.524 --> 00:43:20.524
Why this place?

844
00:43:20.524 --> 00:43:22.563
Mr. Lee is a regular there.

845
00:43:22.563 --> 00:43:23.933
Look after his car.

846
00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.384
The car makes noise because...

847
00:43:38.384 --> 00:43:41.013
of the engine belt problem.

848
00:43:41.353 --> 00:43:43.214
- Okay. - And...

849
00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.824
You should...

850
00:43:45.824 --> 00:43:47.683
change the bearings too.

851
00:43:47.683 --> 00:43:49.554
Okay. Please do that.

852
00:43:49.953 --> 00:43:51.364
Okay, sir.

853
00:43:52.663 --> 00:43:54.563
Then what should I do?

854
00:43:54.563 --> 00:43:56.433
Drink and have fun with ladies.

855
00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.433
What?

856
00:43:57.703 --> 00:43:59.234
Why are you answering to that?

857
00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:02.304
I like that. I like that a lot, Mr. Choi.

858
00:44:02.774 --> 00:44:05.844
Have a lot of fun with this person especially.

859
00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:08.344
Is she pretty?

860
00:44:08.413 --> 00:44:09.413
Let's see.

861
00:44:11.043 --> 00:44:12.344
What? It's a guy.

862
00:44:13.143 --> 00:44:14.614
Any good clubs in Seoul?

863
00:44:15.453 --> 00:44:17.114
There are so many.

864
00:44:20.054 --> 00:44:21.324
Girls will dig you.

865
00:44:21.654 --> 00:44:24.353
Do you want to join and hang out with us?

866
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:26.864
This one's on me.

867
00:44:27.694 --> 00:44:28.763
Shall we go now?

868
00:44:28.763 --> 00:44:30.734
- Sure. - Hey.

869
00:44:31.464 --> 00:44:32.703
I'm so jealous.

870
00:44:33.364 --> 00:44:34.734
Can't I go there?

871
00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:36.973
Places like that are expensive. You got money?

872
00:44:36.973 --> 00:44:38.504
You can give me your card.

873
00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:39.674
But you have an ugly face.

874
00:44:39.674 --> 00:44:41.473
Hey. Look closely.

875
00:44:41.813 --> 00:44:45.043
Hey, Ha Ri. Are you saying that I'm handsome?

876
00:44:47.214 --> 00:44:48.784
No, you look interesting.

877
00:44:48.913 --> 00:44:50.754
Interesting? How?

878
00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.524
Interesting-looking Mr. Kim.

879
00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:54.284
Can you run an errand...

880
00:44:54.284 --> 00:44:55.524
while you are out for a drink?

881
00:44:55.654 --> 00:44:56.793
What errand?

882
00:44:56.793 --> 00:44:59.123
Get the list of Taeyang's insurance planners...

883
00:44:59.123 --> 00:45:01.493
and send it to my friend.

884
00:45:01.493 --> 00:45:03.793
Why do you need a list of insurance planners?

885
00:45:03.793 --> 00:45:05.134
Taeyang and JH.

886
00:45:05.134 --> 00:45:06.404
It's not a simple insurance company...

887
00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:07.563
and subscriber relationship.

888
00:45:08.004 --> 00:45:10.074
Hong Joo was taken aback when I...

889
00:45:10.603 --> 00:45:12.404
brought up corporate succession.

890
00:45:12.404 --> 00:45:15.174
The two companies are in a complicated situation.

891
00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:18.913
Corporate succession. Is it something like that?

892
00:45:21.254 --> 00:45:22.254
Wait.

893
00:45:23.284 --> 00:45:25.154
Reporter Bang told me...

894
00:45:25.154 --> 00:45:27.953
that they acquired the last seven percent...

895
00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:30.094
to secure Vice President Joo's succession...

896
00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:31.723
recently.

897
00:45:33.924 --> 00:45:36.163
How much do you think you need to get...

898
00:45:36.464 --> 00:45:37.734
the seven percent of JH's stock?

899
00:45:39.063 --> 00:45:40.063
10 million dollars.

900
00:45:42.274 --> 00:45:44.904
Where do you think they got that money?

901
00:45:45.004 --> 00:45:47.043
A company with a complicated situation.

902
00:45:47.043 --> 00:45:48.214
Taeyang Insurance?

903
00:45:49.944 --> 00:45:52.513
They couldn't have handed the money in daylight...

904
00:45:52.513 --> 00:45:53.513
because there are too many eyes.

905
00:45:53.513 --> 00:45:55.284
They must've needed...

906
00:45:55.284 --> 00:45:57.583
a bank account to launder money.

907
00:46:00.654 --> 00:46:02.853
Taeyang insurance planners' bank accounts.

908
00:46:04.254 --> 00:46:07.364
Where can I get the list of the insurance planners?

909
00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:09.993
Moo Shin will download it and put it in...

910
00:46:09.993 --> 00:46:11.804
Professor Byeon's cafe.

911
00:46:13.833 --> 00:46:15.504
- Black coffee, please. - Okay.

912
00:46:19.304 --> 00:46:20.603
How is it going, newbie?

913
00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:21.714
Newbie?

914
00:46:24.214 --> 00:46:26.413
I was a newbie at your dance club.

915
00:46:29.013 --> 00:46:30.284
Not that.

916
00:46:30.513 --> 00:46:31.924
You're a Mad Dog newbie.

917
00:46:31.924 --> 00:46:33.953
Me? No, I'm not.

918
00:46:34.723 --> 00:46:37.194
We have buy 1 get 1 free promotion.

919
00:46:38.993 --> 00:46:40.223
Thank you, Professor Byeon.

920
00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:41.964
Newbie.

921
00:46:42.393 --> 00:46:45.134
You should take some vitamin D.

922
00:46:45.134 --> 00:46:48.134
Your face is pale like white flour.

923
00:46:48.134 --> 00:46:50.473
You have weak bones and no muscles, right?

924
00:46:51.243 --> 00:46:52.743
Do you want to see?

925
00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:55.774
I don't have to. I can tell you're thin.

926
00:46:56.774 --> 00:46:58.114
Don't forget to take this.

927
00:46:59.813 --> 00:47:00.884
Please...

928
00:47:01.614 --> 00:47:03.114
take good care of Kang Woo.

929
00:47:03.114 --> 00:47:05.284
Why would I take care of him?

930
00:47:08.853 --> 00:47:10.793
Yes, sir.

931
00:47:10.893 --> 00:47:13.063
I'll take good care of him.

932
00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:14.063
Good.

933
00:47:18.203 --> 00:47:19.404
All right.

934
00:47:42.853 --> 00:47:45.393
Sending the list of insurance planners...

935
00:47:45.393 --> 00:47:46.464
(Sender: Jan Gebauer)

936
00:47:46.464 --> 00:47:49.964
to Lee Kyung Sun.

937
00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:24.234
Thank you for coming all the way here,

938
00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.234
Kyung Sun.

939
00:48:25.234 --> 00:48:26.634
Don't mention it, Mr. Choi.

940
00:48:26.634 --> 00:48:28.634
I checked the list you sent to me.

941
00:48:28.933 --> 00:48:31.844
I brought them with me first.

942
00:48:32.574 --> 00:48:34.574
Mr. Oh Han Seol has been the top planner...

943
00:48:34.574 --> 00:48:35.844
for 10 years in Gangwon Province.

944
00:48:35.844 --> 00:48:37.444
Ms. Park Ho Jung is the top planner...

945
00:48:37.444 --> 00:48:38.583
in Gyeongsang Province.

946
00:48:38.583 --> 00:48:39.683
Ms. Kang Sun Sook is the top planner...

947
00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:41.353
in Jeolla and Chungcheong Province.

948
00:48:49.424 --> 00:48:52.024
Among the planners in the list,

949
00:48:52.024 --> 00:48:54.263
Taeyang has borrowed a total of...

950
00:48:54.263 --> 00:48:56.464
87 planners' names for bank accounts.

951
00:48:56.464 --> 00:48:59.304
35 of them reside in Gyeonggi and Incheon.

952
00:48:59.304 --> 00:49:00.703
The amount is 3.6 million dollars.

953
00:49:01.304 --> 00:49:02.674
15 of them reside in Gangwon,

954
00:49:02.674 --> 00:49:03.774
and the amount is 1.7 million dollars.

955
00:49:03.933 --> 00:49:05.603
16 of them reside in Gyeongsang,

956
00:49:05.603 --> 00:49:06.603
and the amount is 2.3 million dollars.

957
00:49:06.603 --> 00:49:08.444
21 of them reside in Jeolla and Chungcheong,

958
00:49:08.444 --> 00:49:09.714
and the amount is 2.4 million dollars.

959
00:49:10.313 --> 00:49:12.714
When was the money deposited and transferred?

960
00:49:12.714 --> 00:49:14.214
Within a month.

961
00:49:14.214 --> 00:49:16.353
It means they made 10 million dollars...

962
00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:18.353
in a month and bought the shares of JH Group.

963
00:49:18.353 --> 00:49:20.424
About the shares they bought with the money...

964
00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:21.993
from the borrowed-name bank accounts,

965
00:49:22.094 --> 00:49:24.763
they're under the planners' names too.

966
00:49:25.364 --> 00:49:27.194
They shouldn't sell the shares as they want?

967
00:49:27.194 --> 00:49:28.663
They could be charged for violating...

968
00:49:28.663 --> 00:49:29.893
the Real Name Financial Transaction Law.

969
00:49:29.893 --> 00:49:31.734
What should we do then?

970
00:49:31.734 --> 00:49:33.864
Everyone's not feeling good about this.

971
00:49:33.864 --> 00:49:36.404
They can't do this with others' names.

972
00:49:36.603 --> 00:49:39.344
Planners in my district are very upset too.

973
00:49:39.674 --> 00:49:41.574
They're thinking of protesting.

974
00:49:41.574 --> 00:49:42.873
Do protest.

975
00:49:43.074 --> 00:49:45.284
But not against Taeyang.

976
00:49:45.284 --> 00:49:47.083
Do it against those who will actually listen.

977
00:50:03.464 --> 00:50:05.234
Gosh.

978
00:50:08.973 --> 00:50:10.034
Are you okay?

979
00:50:11.004 --> 00:50:12.304
I'm having a sudden stomachache.

980
00:50:12.304 --> 00:50:14.444
Return to your ward, and I'll call the doctor.

981
00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:16.774
No, I mean a toilet.

982
00:50:18.344 --> 00:50:19.513
Go to the toilet in your ward.

983
00:50:20.344 --> 00:50:22.013
It's urgent.

984
00:50:28.993 --> 00:50:31.464
I think it'll be quite loud.

985
00:50:33.694 --> 00:50:35.734
I don't want others to hear me do my business.

986
00:50:45.444 --> 00:50:47.243
Come on.

987
00:50:48.413 --> 00:50:49.873
Stop it. It's gross.

988
00:50:49.873 --> 00:50:51.313
You look like abalone.

989
00:50:51.313 --> 00:50:52.384
Abalone?

990
00:50:58.154 --> 00:50:59.324
Nurse Oh.

991
00:50:59.324 --> 00:51:00.984
Let's hurry.

992
00:51:00.984 --> 00:51:02.924
The operating room needs us now.

993
00:51:02.924 --> 00:51:04.094
We don't have time.

994
00:51:08.464 --> 00:51:09.763
Wait a second.

995
00:51:11.734 --> 00:51:13.433
Pentium, do you think you can run?

996
00:51:13.433 --> 00:51:14.674
My wound...

997
00:51:22.114 --> 00:51:23.513
Well...

998
00:51:23.844 --> 00:51:25.513
If you act like you didn't see this just once,

999
00:51:25.513 --> 00:51:26.614
we'll...

1000
00:51:28.054 --> 00:51:29.284
Return to your ward.

1001
00:51:33.484 --> 00:51:34.924
I knew it.

1002
00:51:36.554 --> 00:51:39.194
I shouldn't do this in a sacred place.

1003
00:51:42.534 --> 00:51:43.594
Guys.

1004
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:44.964
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1005
00:51:48.074 --> 00:51:49.404
Who are you?

1006
00:51:49.404 --> 00:51:51.043
I'm going to take my friend, Pentium,

1007
00:51:51.043 --> 00:51:53.203
no matter what happens today.

1008
00:51:53.703 --> 00:51:54.944
Cheetah.

1009
00:51:55.274 --> 00:51:57.543
You must've led a fine life.

1010
00:52:02.154 --> 00:52:04.824
You need absolute rest in the hospital.

1011
00:52:05.754 --> 00:52:07.793
Why don't you just let us go, fellows?

1012
00:52:14.793 --> 00:52:16.933
An arrest warrant will be issued...

1013
00:52:17.163 --> 00:52:19.163
in the Seoul Prosecutors' Office tomorrow morning.

1014
00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:22.174
Okay. You may go out now.

1015
00:52:33.513 --> 00:52:35.214
The insurance policy...

1016
00:52:35.214 --> 00:52:37.824
and black box footage are still in my hands,

1017
00:52:37.824 --> 00:52:39.623
but they'll proceed?

1018
00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:46.623
Hong Joo.

1019
00:52:48.393 --> 00:52:51.263
Do you really want me to go crazy...

1020
00:52:51.263 --> 00:52:53.304
and go down with you?

1021
00:53:08.183 --> 00:53:09.714
(Joo Hyun Ki)

1022
00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:13.424
How long do we have left...

1023
00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:15.853
until the arrest warrant is issued?

1024
00:53:16.123 --> 00:53:17.864
It'll be issued tomorrow morning.

1025
00:53:18.824 --> 00:53:20.623
I hope it's issued soon.

1026
00:53:21.763 --> 00:53:24.034
I don't want to see his name on my phone anymore.

1027
00:53:27.433 --> 00:53:30.274
(Chief On Joo Sik)

1028
00:53:33.904 --> 00:53:35.143
(Cha Hong Joo)

1029
00:53:38.513 --> 00:53:40.344
So you're saying...

1030
00:53:40.714 --> 00:53:43.614
that I've stepped in the wrong direction?

1031
00:53:43.884 --> 00:53:45.754
You knew that the illegal funds...

1032
00:53:45.754 --> 00:53:47.683
were used for the succession...

1033
00:53:47.683 --> 00:53:48.824
of JH Group, right?

1034
00:53:50.324 --> 00:53:51.493
Here's...

1035
00:53:53.194 --> 00:53:54.263
the evidence.

1036
00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:02.433
(Borrowed Name Bank Accounts)

1037
00:54:05.603 --> 00:54:07.004
Chairman Cha...

1038
00:54:07.574 --> 00:54:09.074
created a slush fund...

1039
00:54:09.844 --> 00:54:11.913
and committed embezzlement and malpractice.

1040
00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:15.484
You want me to take down Chairman Cha first?

1041
00:54:15.754 --> 00:54:16.754
Why?

1042
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:19.154
There's a proper order for everything, you see.

1043
00:54:21.623 --> 00:54:23.154
What if I turn...

1044
00:54:23.154 --> 00:54:25.324
a blind eye on this?

1045
00:54:25.324 --> 00:54:26.563
After 30 minutes,

1046
00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:28.493
the real owners...

1047
00:54:28.493 --> 00:54:29.933
of those bank accounts...

1048
00:54:30.194 --> 00:54:31.433
will report this to each bank...

1049
00:54:31.433 --> 00:54:33.263
and freeze the accounts.

1050
00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.804
So this will be revealed...

1051
00:54:38.543 --> 00:54:40.344
even if I ignore it?

1052
00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:43.444
Thank you in advance, Chief On.

1053
00:54:48.554 --> 00:54:49.853
One more thing.

1054
00:55:11.243 --> 00:55:12.404
Yes, Chief On.

1055
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.313
What? Let him go?

1056
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:17.984
Yes, sir.

1057
00:55:19.643 --> 00:55:20.944
He wants us to let you go.

1058
00:55:21.214 --> 00:55:22.484
My father does?

1059
00:55:22.984 --> 00:55:25.754
We're free to go?

1060
00:55:27.183 --> 00:55:28.293
Guys.

1061
00:55:28.493 --> 00:55:29.654
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1062
00:55:46.944 --> 00:55:48.743
Is the warrant issued?

1063
00:55:49.413 --> 00:55:50.444
Yes, sir.

1064
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:52.484
It is issued, but...

1065
00:55:57.154 --> 00:55:58.254
Chairman Cha.

1066
00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:00.453
We're from Special Investigation Team Two.

1067
00:56:01.493 --> 00:56:03.154
We'll proceed search and seizure for violating...

1068
00:56:03.154 --> 00:56:05.123
Real Name Financial Transaction Law,

1069
00:56:05.123 --> 00:56:08.194
Procedure for Punishment of Tax Evaders Act,

1070
00:56:08.333 --> 00:56:09.993
and Framework Act on Employment Policy,

1071
00:56:09.993 --> 00:56:11.703
and for embezzlement and malpractice.

1072
00:56:12.433 --> 00:56:13.864
What are you doing?

1073
00:56:14.063 --> 00:56:15.534
This isn't the right target.

1074
00:56:19.643 --> 00:56:20.944
Chief On,

1075
00:56:21.214 --> 00:56:22.844
you didn't have to come all the way here.

1076
00:56:24.643 --> 00:56:28.254
I came here myself because I wanted to...

1077
00:56:28.813 --> 00:56:30.453
show respect.

1078
00:56:31.484 --> 00:56:32.524
Chairman Cha.

1079
00:56:32.884 --> 00:56:35.154
Will you go down with handcuffs on...

1080
00:56:36.154 --> 00:56:38.263
or on a wheelchair?

1081
00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.163
Hong Joo.

1082
00:56:42.933 --> 00:56:45.833
Go find a wheelchair.

1083
00:56:48.873 --> 00:56:51.274
Earlier this morning, the chairman...

1084
00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.074
of the biggest insurance company, Taeyang,

1085
00:56:53.074 --> 00:56:54.873
appeared for questioning the prosecutors' office.

1086
00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:57.614
Chairman Cha was on a wheelchair...

1087
00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.683
and entered the office for investigation...

1088
00:56:59.683 --> 00:57:01.884
without giving any answer to reporters' questions.

1089
00:57:03.054 --> 00:57:05.683
He looks very ill.

1090
00:57:08.694 --> 00:57:10.924
Nice move.

1091
00:57:12.924 --> 00:57:15.034
You took down Chairman Cha first,

1092
00:57:15.034 --> 00:57:16.993
and now, who's next?

1093
00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:18.763
Mr. Choi.

1094
00:57:21.074 --> 00:57:22.734
- Let us pass through. - Please say a word.

1095
00:57:22.973 --> 00:57:23.973
Please make way.

1096
00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:26.274
Do you admit to your charges?

1097
00:57:42.493 --> 00:57:43.853
Here's a special meal for you.

1098
00:57:44.793 --> 00:57:46.663
Come on.

1099
00:57:46.793 --> 00:57:47.793
It's abalone.

1100
00:57:55.703 --> 00:57:56.873
Mr. Kim.

1101
00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.373
You changed everything on the computer.

1102
00:57:59.574 --> 00:58:02.274
There's no need to complain.

1103
00:58:02.413 --> 00:58:04.174
It'll be convenient once you get used to it.

1104
00:58:04.174 --> 00:58:06.344
No way. Do you want to bet?

1105
00:58:06.344 --> 00:58:07.583
A bet?

1106
00:58:08.013 --> 00:58:10.083
We put a leash on...

1107
00:58:10.614 --> 00:58:12.123
Cha Joon Kyu.

1108
00:58:12.384 --> 00:58:13.583
What's his daughter up to?

1109
00:58:21.194 --> 00:58:22.933
She's entering a restaurant.

1110
00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:24.563
Did people from the Department of Transport...

1111
00:58:24.563 --> 00:58:25.663
arrive as well?

1112
00:58:25.663 --> 00:58:28.174
They arrived 30 minutes earlier.

1113
00:58:28.174 --> 00:58:30.973
Have you got acquainted with them?

1114
00:58:30.973 --> 00:58:33.873
I have, but they drive me crazy.

1115
00:58:33.873 --> 00:58:34.913
They talk too much.

1116
00:58:34.913 --> 00:58:37.513
They complain about calls from Director Cha.

1117
00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.313
We got to know them well.

1118
00:58:39.313 --> 00:58:41.813
They told us their meeting time and place.

1119
00:58:42.614 --> 00:58:44.214
Mr. Kim tends to grope.

1120
00:58:44.214 --> 00:58:45.453
Grope?

1121
00:58:45.453 --> 00:58:46.984
Are you saying that I'm touching you?

1122
00:58:46.984 --> 00:58:48.353
You startled me.

1123
00:58:48.353 --> 00:58:49.824
Mind your own business.

1124
00:58:50.123 --> 00:58:53.094
He was being touchy-feely on a street last time.

1125
00:58:53.524 --> 00:58:54.534
Touchy-feely?

1126
00:58:57.703 --> 00:58:59.734
I won't let him get away with this.

1127
00:59:07.473 --> 00:59:08.844
It's nice to meet you.

1128
00:59:09.143 --> 00:59:11.543
I'm Cha Hong Joo from Taeyang Insurance.

1129
00:59:11.543 --> 00:59:13.043
I'm Cho Sung Ho from...

1130
00:59:13.043 --> 00:59:14.413
International Air Transport Division.

1131
00:59:14.413 --> 00:59:16.913
There's so many.

1132
00:59:16.913 --> 00:59:18.424
I'm Park Dong Chul...

1133
00:59:18.424 --> 00:59:19.683
from Air Industry Division.

1134
00:59:19.683 --> 00:59:21.554
Okay. Please do that.

1135
00:59:22.853 --> 00:59:25.393
December 13, 2014.

1136
00:59:25.964 --> 00:59:27.594
Employees who permitted...

1137
00:59:27.594 --> 00:59:29.433
the increase of Juhan Air's flights.

1138
00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.804
Cho Sung Ho, Park Dong Chul.

1139
00:59:32.703 --> 00:59:34.734
It's Cha Hong Joo's last card...

1140
00:59:34.734 --> 00:59:36.004
to pressure Chief On.

1141
00:59:37.404 --> 00:59:38.774
Cha Hong Joo.

1142
00:59:50.254 --> 00:59:51.623
Joo Hyun Ki.

1143
00:59:53.284 --> 00:59:55.123
You killed my family...

1144
00:59:55.123 --> 00:59:56.694
by crashing Flight 801.

1145
01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.274
They blamed everything...

1146
01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:13.373
on Min Joon's brother, Kim Bum Joon.

1147
01:00:15.274 --> 01:00:16.274
I will arrest you...

1148
01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.384
no matter what.

1149
01:00:19.714 --> 01:00:20.813
You just wait.

1150
01:00:52.913 --> 01:00:55.784
(Mad Dog)

1151
01:00:56.413 --> 01:00:59.424
Where is Chief On?

1152
01:00:59.754 --> 01:01:01.353
Is it my father's fault?

1153
01:01:01.694 --> 01:01:02.824
The assailant's family...

1154
01:01:02.824 --> 01:01:04.763
doesn't deserve to live.

1155
01:01:05.563 --> 01:01:08.134
Your daughter must have been impatient.

1156
01:01:08.433 --> 01:01:10.134
You want me...

1157
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.603
to do the dirty work instead of your daughter?

1158
01:01:13.933 --> 01:01:15.933
Have you decided...

1159
01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:17.534
to be on my side?

1160
01:01:17.873 --> 01:01:20.703
I can be where I'm today...

1161
01:01:20.703 --> 01:01:22.944
thanks to you, Mr. Choi.

1162
01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:24.513
Let's turn the table.

1163
01:01:24.513 --> 01:01:26.784
We'll take the bait.

1164
01:01:27.013 --> 01:01:28.453
Tell me that I did well.

1165
01:01:28.784 --> 01:01:30.453
From now on,

1166
01:01:30.784 --> 01:01:33.024
watch carefully how I make it happen.
