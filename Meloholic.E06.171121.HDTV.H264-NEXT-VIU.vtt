1
00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:23.599
Ye Ri.

2
00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.199
Are you okay? What's going on?

3
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.470
What are you wearing?

4
00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:37.925
Run, Eun Ho.

5
00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:39.565
He's behind you.

6
00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:57.885
Long time no see, Eun Ho.

7
00:00:58.484 --> 00:00:59.544
You are...

8
00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:00.854
I gave her...

9
00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:03.624
the clothes as my present.

10
00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:05.854
She looks good in it, right?

11
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:07.594
You are a psycho.

12
00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:10.964
Don't push my buttons. You better leave now.

13
00:01:21.604 --> 00:01:23.305
Don't. This is too dangerous.

14
00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:25.604
Close your eyes and count to 10.

15
00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.044
I will end this in 10 seconds.

16
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:30.744
You jerk.

17
00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:34.415
You piece of jerk.

18
00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:13.625
You better stay quiet.

19
00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:16.824
I will take this off if you promise you will stay quiet.

20
00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:35.745
Do you remember...

21
00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:40.054
the first day we met?

22
00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:43.054
All right. The psychology of the criminals.

23
00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:47.894
A German profiler, Niche, said this.

24
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.524
I fell in love with you at first sight.

25
00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:51.824
I could see you were hiding something.

26
00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:54.394
Your mysterious image caught my attention.

27
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.635
They're born with it.

28
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:02.435
Excuse me.

29
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:04.405
Excuse me.

30
00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:07.415
Sorry to interrupt you.

31
00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.345
I want to be your friend.

32
00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:13.984
- May I have your number? - What?

33
00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.054
Hey.

34
00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:20.125
Sorry.

35
00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:28.764
Byung Cheol.

36
00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:38.304
It's refreshing.

37
00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:40.514
Can I take this?

38
00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:42.174
You can take it all.

39
00:03:45.144 --> 00:03:46.855
Goodness.

40
00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:48.954
What's wrong? I am Byung Cheol.

41
00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.524
I don't know who you are.

42
00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:54.425
Who are you? You pervert.

43
00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:57.425
- You pervert. - You kept playing with me.

44
00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:59.425
- You pervert. - You kept playing with me.

45
00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:00.664
You pervert.

46
00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:03.435
I didn't know why you were doing that.

47
00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:05.635
I was so...

48
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.474
excited.

49
00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:15.774
You trained me like a keeper.

50
00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:19.315
The more you trained me, the deeper I fell in love with you.

51
00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:20.855
It was...

52
00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:25.355
so thrilling. It was my first time to feel that way.

53
00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:28.695
This is crazy.

54
00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:30.964
What?

55
00:04:30.964 --> 00:04:32.865
Nothing.

56
00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:41.105
You told me not to phone you again.

57
00:04:42.135 --> 00:04:43.904
I even left the college to forget about you.

58
00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:47.074
But you kept doubting me for harassing Eun Ho.

59
00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:51.545
This is all because of you.

60
00:04:52.414 --> 00:04:53.985
You came between us.

61
00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:56.755
We wouldn't have had problems if it weren't for you.

62
00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.685
Byung Cheol, calm down.

63
00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:01.824
Please listen to me.

64
00:05:01.824 --> 00:05:03.495
We study psychology.

65
00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:06.365
Let's discuss this problem in a psychological way.

66
00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:11.264
Hey. What are you doing?

67
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:15.474
Don't worry.

68
00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:18.505
I will only hit your face.

69
00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:20.245
Please don't do this.

70
00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:21.574
Don't.

71
00:05:21.844 --> 00:05:24.615
It's going to hurt. Clench your teeth.

72
00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.185
No. Don't do it.

73
00:05:34.894 --> 00:05:35.995
Ye Ri.

74
00:05:36.255 --> 00:05:38.925
Ye Ri. Ye Ri.

75
00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:43.505
Ye Ri.

76
00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:46.505
Ye Ri.

77
00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:50.105
Wake up, Ye Ri.

78
00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:54.914
Ye Ri.

79
00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:00.284
Ye Ri.

80
00:06:03.784 --> 00:06:04.824
Ye Ri.

81
00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.425
Are you awake? Are you okay?

82
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.365
I am not okay.

83
00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:13.264
It hurts a lot.

84
00:06:14.164 --> 00:06:16.865
It would have been worse if my pretty face got hurt.

85
00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:20.034
Are you Ju Ri?

86
00:06:20.034 --> 00:06:21.074
You are so dumb.

87
00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:23.605
If you finished your relationship with Ye Ri like I told you,

88
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:25.375
this wouldn't have happened.

89
00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:27.745
Why did you put yourself into this?

90
00:06:27.844 --> 00:06:29.315
It's all because of you.

91
00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:31.214
He was so giving to me...

92
00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:33.584
whenever I treated him nicely.

93
00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:36.284
So I was going to stop meeting him after a while.

94
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.355
I didn't know he would be a stalker like this.

95
00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:40.495
Don't.

96
00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:44.094
At first, I thought he was just a slow-witted person.

97
00:06:44.324 --> 00:06:48.664
Gosh. He was a pervert.

98
00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.404
Be quiet.

99
00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:52.904
What?

100
00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:05.385
Calm down, pervert.

101
00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:09.685
Sorry...

102
00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:12.154
but I love you.

103
00:07:15.954 --> 00:07:16.995
No.

104
00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:24.235
- Are you okay, Ju Ri? - Yes.

105
00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:32.204
I will you kill you if you hurt her.

106
00:07:33.074 --> 00:07:34.144
He's charming.

107
00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:41.714
What are you going to do about this?

108
00:07:41.714 --> 00:07:43.385
What are you going to do about this?

109
00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:47.894
Tell me. What are you going to do?

110
00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:49.654
- What are you going to do? - I will do as you say.

111
00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:57.435
I will do everything as you say, so stop.

112
00:08:01.674 --> 00:08:04.245
You will do everything?

113
00:08:05.544 --> 00:08:06.544
Really?

114
00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:08.174
No.

115
00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:10.715
Yes. I promise.

116
00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:12.885
But...

117
00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:16.885
- Nothing. - What is it?

118
00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:18.554
What were you going to say?

119
00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:21.694
I can't say it. He's watching.

120
00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:23.965
I'm shy to say it.

121
00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:27.664
What is it? Tell me.

122
00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:29.064
Lend me your ears.

123
00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:54.725
Pervert deserves beating.

124
00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:57.995
This is what I wanted to say. Do you understand?

125
00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:01.735
Get up. He's down.

126
00:09:07.674 --> 00:09:11.274
I won't forgive you in the name of justice.

127
00:09:13.144 --> 00:09:14.814
Ta-da.

128
00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:18.514
How could you pretend like...

129
00:09:18.644 --> 00:09:20.654
you were dating my friend even if you were angry?

130
00:09:22.085 --> 00:09:25.154
If you do this again, I will give you a hard time.

131
00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:27.654
You have to answer your phone right away whenever I phone you.

132
00:09:29.455 --> 00:09:32.064
I hate when a guy is so obsessive.

133
00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:36.294
Obsession is love's another name.

134
00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:38.034
That's why...

135
00:09:38.835 --> 00:09:40.804
I am obsessed with you.

136
00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:43.705
What are you saying?

137
00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:45.644
You are so obsessed.

138
00:09:52.684 --> 00:09:55.755
Gosh. I was about to finish him.

139
00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:58.755
Enjoy your time in jail.

140
00:10:00.255 --> 00:10:01.725
What are you looking at?

141
00:10:08.564 --> 00:10:10.205
Ye Ri. What's going on?

142
00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:13.005
Nice to see you again, Yeo Jin.

143
00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:14.904
Have you been well?

144
00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:17.105
What?

145
00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:18.505
Don't you know how to greet people?

146
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.314
What's happened to your face, Eun Ho? Did you get in a fight?

147
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.745
Nothing.

148
00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:28.355
Eun Ho.

149
00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:32.355
You have to go to the hospital.

150
00:10:32.355 --> 00:10:33.355
Okay.

151
00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:34.955
And Ye Ri.

152
00:10:35.154 --> 00:10:36.995
You have to come with me to the police station...

153
00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:39.064
and write a statement.

154
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:42.434
No. I want to stay with Eun Ho.

155
00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:48.205
I think I am in love with Eun Ho.

156
00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:49.804
What?

157
00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:53.075
Hey.

158
00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:55.814
Are you okay?

159
00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:57.284
What's going on?

160
00:10:57.284 --> 00:11:00.615
Why did you do that? I am sorry, Eun Ho.

161
00:11:22.904 --> 00:11:25.044
Eun Ho. What happened to your face?

162
00:11:25.674 --> 00:11:26.715
I am okay.

163
00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:47.664
- Hey. - Yes?

164
00:11:47.835 --> 00:11:50.164
You look so happy today.

165
00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:55.875
There was something that bothered me for a long time.

166
00:11:56.745 --> 00:11:59.075
But it started to work out.

167
00:12:00.044 --> 00:12:01.914
I have a feeling that it will work out well.

168
00:12:11.385 --> 00:12:13.095
It's quite late now.

169
00:12:14.355 --> 00:12:15.924
I need to start closing up the store.

170
00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:18.595
I was about to leave too.

171
00:12:18.595 --> 00:12:20.495
There is a new noodle place just across the road.

172
00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:22.095
Do you want to go there with me?

173
00:12:22.664 --> 00:12:24.034
I will take you to the bus station.

174
00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:26.774
Just give me five minutes.

175
00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.115
- Hey. - Yes?

176
00:12:33.514 --> 00:12:35.774
- The girlfriend you mentioned... - Yes.

177
00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:37.845
What is her name?

178
00:12:40.554 --> 00:12:41.615
Why do you ask?

179
00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:44.325
I was just curious.

180
00:13:00.804 --> 00:13:01.975
I don't understand.

181
00:13:02.674 --> 00:13:05.774
You said Ju Ri appears when you get proposed in front of people.

182
00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:08.544
Then why did she appear earlier?

183
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:10.985
I think I was too nervous.

184
00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:14.085
I didn't want you to get hurt.

185
00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:17.625
Ju Ri...

186
00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:20.725
only appears when someone calls her.

187
00:13:22.294 --> 00:13:24.264
When the person is standing in front of my eyes.

188
00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:26.024
And...

189
00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:28.894
when I get nervous or excited...

190
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.835
because of the person.

191
00:13:33.274 --> 00:13:34.335
Good then.

192
00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:36.845
Don't get nervous or excited...

193
00:13:37.245 --> 00:13:38.804
when you are with me.

194
00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:41.245
Then we are good, right?

195
00:13:42.475 --> 00:13:43.914
I am not a monk.

196
00:13:44.814 --> 00:13:47.085
She will appear as soon as I lose my senses.

197
00:13:48.784 --> 00:13:51.654
Okay. Then tell her to come out. I don't care.

198
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.755
You can't take her.

199
00:13:57.524 --> 00:14:00.995
She will try everything she can...

200
00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:02.495
in order to make us fall apart.

201
00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:04.505
I can take her.

202
00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:07.304
- You can't. - I can.

203
00:14:10.845 --> 00:14:13.715
Can you really take her?

204
00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:22.485
You don't know it.

205
00:14:23.524 --> 00:14:25.755
There are so many clothes like this in my closet.

206
00:14:26.955 --> 00:14:28.495
There are so many things that I don't even know.

207
00:14:29.054 --> 00:14:31.064
I wear this kind of clothes without my knowledge.

208
00:14:31.865 --> 00:14:34.294
And I walk around doing weird things.

209
00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:36.904
I can't even take it.

210
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.465
How are you going to take this?

211
00:14:45.544 --> 00:14:46.715
What's wrong with that?

212
00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:48.875
I like you so much.

213
00:14:57.654 --> 00:14:58.725
Ye Ri.

214
00:14:59.894 --> 00:15:02.894
Whether you're Sailor Moon or not, I still like you.

215
00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:06.064
Even if you wear worse costumes...

216
00:15:06.064 --> 00:15:07.934
or you do even worst things,

217
00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:10.135
it doesn't matter to me.

218
00:15:11.304 --> 00:15:14.635
No matter what, I like you so much.

219
00:15:16.105 --> 00:15:18.644
I don't think I can live without seeing you anymore.

220
00:15:19.644 --> 00:15:20.814
I feel the same.

221
00:15:22.144 --> 00:15:25.944
It feels like my heart will blow because I like you so much.

222
00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:31.554
If you lose your senses,

223
00:15:32.255 --> 00:15:33.794
Ju Ri might appear, right?

224
00:15:33.794 --> 00:15:34.825
No.

225
00:15:35.095 --> 00:15:37.995
It takes a while for her to appear. Why?

226
00:15:38.495 --> 00:15:39.934
Then I can do this now.

227
00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:41.635
Do what?

228
00:16:38.754 --> 00:16:40.724
This is not right though.

229
00:16:41.394 --> 00:16:42.625
I think this isn't right.

230
00:16:42.894 --> 00:16:45.424
How am I going to let you sleep in that house?

231
00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:50.204
It's also not right to be with you tonight as well.

232
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.275
I can take things slowly.

233
00:16:54.674 --> 00:16:57.275
What if someone hears you?

234
00:16:57.275 --> 00:16:58.704
Gosh.

235
00:16:58.704 --> 00:17:01.644
What? There are only two of us.

236
00:17:02.214 --> 00:17:03.214
Gosh.

237
00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:10.785
Get out. This is my room.

238
00:17:17.424 --> 00:17:18.494
Take this.

239
00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:20.494
If there is anything you need, just ask me.

240
00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:22.135
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

241
00:17:22.865 --> 00:17:24.135
And I am sorry.

242
00:17:24.504 --> 00:17:28.075
There's nothing to be sorry about. You did a great job today. Rest now.

243
00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:30.244
Get out. What are you doing here?

244
00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:31.805
Get out. You should rest now.

245
00:17:31.805 --> 00:17:33.714
- Let's go. Sleep tight. - Yes.

246
00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:35.015
Come.

247
00:17:35.315 --> 00:17:36.984
Good night. Dream of me tonight.

248
00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:38.515
Dream of me too.

249
00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:41.714
- Come. - Get out.

250
00:17:43.154 --> 00:17:44.785
They are crazy.

251
00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:48.994
I am very sensitive in my sleeping so please be careful.

252
00:17:49.254 --> 00:17:50.325
Okay.

253
00:17:56.404 --> 00:17:57.605
Good night.

254
00:18:00.674 --> 00:18:01.674
Sorry.

255
00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:03.775
May I borrow your clothes?

256
00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:25.125
She's so cute.

257
00:18:36.704 --> 00:18:37.775
Are you sleeping?

258
00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:47.285
- No. I can't sleep now. - Why not?

259
00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:51.454
I think it's because this isn't my house.

260
00:18:54.355 --> 00:18:55.694
I can't sleep either.

261
00:18:55.994 --> 00:18:57.394
My heart flutters because of you.

262
00:18:57.394 --> 00:19:02.095
(I can't sleep either. My heart flutters because of you.)

263
00:19:20.184 --> 00:19:21.585
Don't worry about anything from now on.

264
00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:25.184
Byung Cheol is gone, and everything will be okay.

265
00:19:25.454 --> 00:19:26.795
(Byung Cheol is gone, and everything will be okay.)

266
00:19:31.095 --> 00:19:33.434
Okay. Thank you.

267
00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:36.265
Good night.

268
00:19:36.734 --> 00:19:37.765
You too.

269
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:03.265
They were texting each other all night long.

270
00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:05.295
That's why I could not sleep.

271
00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:08.434
Is she going to stay at your place from now on?

272
00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:10.805
No. I won't let her.

273
00:20:10.964 --> 00:20:13.105
She will move out as soon as she finds a place to stay.

274
00:20:13.805 --> 00:20:14.875
Will she?

275
00:20:15.135 --> 00:20:17.105
Did she sort out her stalker?

276
00:20:17.105 --> 00:20:18.144
I think so.

277
00:20:18.504 --> 00:20:20.144
That's so scary.

278
00:20:21.115 --> 00:20:24.315
Isn't it right to wish the best for the person that you like?

279
00:20:24.414 --> 00:20:26.815
I didn't know this, but it was her stalker...

280
00:20:26.815 --> 00:20:28.015
who hurt Eun Ho's hand.

281
00:20:28.015 --> 00:20:29.315
He broke the bike too.

282
00:20:30.325 --> 00:20:31.355
He's crazy.

283
00:20:31.654 --> 00:20:33.825
Why would he do such things?

284
00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:37.795
You're right.

285
00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:39.424
Why would he do such things?

286
00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:41.994
You're so handsome.

287
00:21:03.224 --> 00:21:04.355
Cheers.

288
00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:06.254
- Cheers. - Cheers.

289
00:21:06.254 --> 00:21:07.724
- Cheers. - Cheers.

290
00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:11.625
I didn't expect Byung Cheol to do such things.

291
00:21:12.065 --> 00:21:14.234
He looks like a nerd,

292
00:21:14.434 --> 00:21:16.565
but he was actually a double-faced man.

293
00:21:18.835 --> 00:21:20.575
You guys are wasting the drinks.

294
00:21:22.674 --> 00:21:24.744
Is it okay for you to drink?

295
00:21:24.744 --> 00:21:26.515
It's okay. This isn't a lot.

296
00:21:26.515 --> 00:21:27.775
She can drink a lot.

297
00:21:27.974 --> 00:21:31.144
She drinks more than Ju Ri.

298
00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:36.684
Unless Ye Ri gets sexually attracted to you...

299
00:21:37.154 --> 00:21:40.154
and loses her senses,

300
00:21:40.154 --> 00:21:41.994
Ju Ri won't be appearing at this moment.

301
00:21:43.325 --> 00:21:45.325
Who is Ju Ri?

302
00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:47.535
Gosh. Just eat this.

303
00:21:49.335 --> 00:21:51.135
Isn't that Mr. Kim?

304
00:21:52.365 --> 00:21:53.404
What?

305
00:21:54.474 --> 00:21:56.305
- I had a girlfriend. - I think he's drunk.

306
00:21:56.305 --> 00:21:57.504
We broke up today.

307
00:21:58.404 --> 00:22:00.214
We decided to stay as friends. I am sad.

308
00:22:00.714 --> 00:22:01.845
Did something happen to him?

309
00:22:04.085 --> 00:22:05.115
Let's join him.

310
00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.714
- What? - Why?

311
00:22:07.714 --> 00:22:09.214
He might pay for our drinks.

312
00:22:09.355 --> 00:22:11.724
He won't ask us to pay. He's our professor.

313
00:22:12.184 --> 00:22:14.055
Okay. Let's do that.

314
00:22:14.055 --> 00:22:16.825
We can cheer him up and he might let you stay longer with us.

315
00:22:17.924 --> 00:22:19.365
- It's okay. - Hey.

316
00:22:19.934 --> 00:22:21.035
Let's go.

317
00:22:23.934 --> 00:22:25.135
Can you not hear me?

318
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.135
Mr. Kim.

319
00:22:26.135 --> 00:22:27.775
What are you guys doing here?

320
00:22:27.775 --> 00:22:28.934
You can stay there for a long time.

321
00:22:29.704 --> 00:22:31.644
Guys are so funny.

322
00:22:41.914 --> 00:22:43.724
- Drink. - Drink.

323
00:22:44.055 --> 00:22:45.855
Why are you drinking so much?

324
00:22:45.855 --> 00:22:46.954
Did something happen to you?

325
00:22:47.654 --> 00:22:48.654
What?

326
00:22:49.254 --> 00:22:50.494
Hey, you jerk.

327
00:22:50.894 --> 00:22:53.734
You think you know everything?

328
00:22:53.734 --> 00:22:56.434
You don't. You only know what women think.

329
00:22:56.434 --> 00:22:58.605
You only know what women think.

330
00:22:58.605 --> 00:22:59.704
Did you all know this?

331
00:22:59.704 --> 00:23:02.305
If he holds a woman's hand like this,

332
00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:04.974
he knows what that woman's thinking.

333
00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:08.045
I think he's so drunk.

334
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.184
Stop it now.

335
00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:16.085
Hey.

336
00:23:16.785 --> 00:23:19.795
We decided to stay as friends. We should not do this.

337
00:23:19.954 --> 00:23:21.254
- Hey. - My love.

338
00:23:21.254 --> 00:23:22.454
Wake up.

339
00:23:22.454 --> 00:23:24.865
I can't forget about you.

340
00:23:25.994 --> 00:23:28.994
Why are you drinking so much today?

341
00:23:29.394 --> 00:23:32.535
I walked around a lot today, so the drinks taste even better.

342
00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:36.845
You should not get drunk. It's so crowded here too.

343
00:23:36.845 --> 00:23:40.515
Don't worry. I won't get drunk.

344
00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:44.214
I am so tired today, so my heart won't beat fast.

345
00:23:44.744 --> 00:23:46.484
Stop nagging and just drink.

346
00:23:46.484 --> 00:23:48.184
- Cheers. - Cheers.

347
00:23:49.615 --> 00:23:55.095
Put your hands up

348
00:23:55.095 --> 00:23:57.194
Drink it up and look at those people

349
00:23:57.194 --> 00:23:59.365
Feel it and look at those people

350
00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:01.535
Laugh and look at those people

351
00:24:01.535 --> 00:24:03.664
Where? Right here

352
00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:05.664
Right here

353
00:24:05.664 --> 00:24:09.434
Right here, right here, right here

354
00:24:13.974 --> 00:24:15.214
Hello.

355
00:24:15.644 --> 00:24:16.944
Nice to see you all.

356
00:24:17.315 --> 00:24:19.954
It has been a year...

357
00:24:20.615 --> 00:24:25.055
since we opened this pub.

358
00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:31.365
We've prepared...

359
00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:35.635
10 admission tickets as a present.

360
00:24:38.535 --> 00:24:41.434
Well, it's not for free.

361
00:24:41.535 --> 00:24:45.204
On this stage right here,

362
00:24:45.444 --> 00:24:48.315
if anyone shows off...

363
00:24:48.515 --> 00:24:51.615
his fantastic skills,

364
00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:54.654
I will give the present away.

365
00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:58.984
Anyone?

366
00:24:59.454 --> 00:25:00.595
- Hey. - Yes?

367
00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:02.494
- Go there. - Me?

368
00:25:03.194 --> 00:25:04.194
- Hurry. - I don't want to.

369
00:25:04.194 --> 00:25:05.224
Are you going to pay for all these drinks? Just go.

370
00:25:05.224 --> 00:25:06.325
Anyone?

371
00:25:06.894 --> 00:25:08.765
- Me. - There is someone.

372
00:25:08.765 --> 00:25:10.605
Please give him a round of applause.

373
00:25:10.835 --> 00:25:12.305
- Come out. - Go for it.

374
00:25:12.305 --> 00:25:14.404
- Go for it. - Yoo Sik.

375
00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:16.234
Thank you for participating.

376
00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:18.805
- He's so handsome. - Eun Ho. Try it as well.

377
00:25:18.805 --> 00:25:19.815
Why?

378
00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:21.615
- You should participate. - No.

379
00:25:21.615 --> 00:25:23.585
Go. Try it.

380
00:25:23.684 --> 00:25:25.214
Go for it.

381
00:25:25.515 --> 00:25:27.254
- We'll begin it right now. - Go.

382
00:25:27.254 --> 00:25:28.914
- Are you ready? - Yes.

383
00:25:28.914 --> 00:25:30.525
We will start with the music.

384
00:25:30.785 --> 00:25:32.984
- There is another participant. - Good. There's one more.

385
00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:34.525
Please give him a round of applause.

386
00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:39.595
We will begin the competition now.

387
00:25:39.595 --> 00:25:41.135
Please start the music.

388
00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:02.484
Yoo Sik, you're awesome.

389
00:26:02.484 --> 00:26:03.785
You guys rock.

390
00:26:13.295 --> 00:26:14.565
My heart flutters.

391
00:26:15.894 --> 00:26:18.664
Calm down, Ye Ri.

392
00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:24.974
Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Baekdusan Mountain are...

393
00:26:26.075 --> 00:26:30.115
dry and worn away

394
00:26:31.015 --> 00:26:35.885
God will help us

395
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:38.825
Hurrah to our country

396
00:26:53.035 --> 00:26:54.605
Scream.

397
00:26:56.545 --> 00:26:57.575
Gosh.

398
00:26:58.004 --> 00:27:00.244
- You guys are great. - Gosh.

399
00:27:00.244 --> 00:27:02.345
Ye Ri. What's wrong?

400
00:27:02.345 --> 00:27:03.414
Ye Ri.

401
00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:05.545
Ye Ri. Wake up.

402
00:27:05.545 --> 00:27:08.315
Ye Ri. Wake up.

403
00:27:08.315 --> 00:27:10.585
- Ye Ri. Wake up. - Is there anyone...

404
00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:13.894
who can dance better than these two men?

405
00:27:13.894 --> 00:27:15.555
- Wake up. - Anyone?

406
00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:19.734
- Anyone? - Bring it on.

407
00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:20.835
- Ye Ri. - Bring it on.

408
00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:22.295
- Wake up. - Bring it on.

409
00:27:22.295 --> 00:27:24.234
We will finish the competition then.

410
00:27:24.234 --> 00:27:25.234
- Okay. - Okay.

411
00:27:25.234 --> 00:27:26.305
I will participate.

412
00:27:26.434 --> 00:27:28.575
There is a lady. Please give her a round of applause.

413
00:27:34.714 --> 00:27:36.345
Ju Ri, are you drunk?

414
00:27:36.345 --> 00:27:38.515
Yes, yes, and yes.

415
00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:40.855
I am so drunk.

416
00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:42.855
You are drunk. This isn't good.

417
00:27:42.855 --> 00:27:44.855
Are you guys having fun?

418
00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:48.325
Are you ready to enjoy your night?

419
00:27:48.325 --> 00:27:50.825
- Yes. - Yes.

420
00:27:51.424 --> 00:27:55.734
Hey DJ, drop the beat.

421
00:27:58.404 --> 00:28:02.904
Yes, yes, yes

422
00:28:03.305 --> 00:28:08.575
Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Baekdusan Mountain are...

423
00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:11.244
God will help us

424
00:28:11.244 --> 00:28:13.555
Hurrah to our country

425
00:28:13.555 --> 00:28:16.085
Hurrah to our country

426
00:28:16.085 --> 00:28:17.924
Put your hands up

427
00:28:17.924 --> 00:28:20.595
Put your hands up

428
00:28:20.595 --> 00:28:22.254
- Hurrah to our country - Stop.

429
00:28:22.254 --> 00:28:23.464
Hurrah to our country

430
00:28:23.464 --> 00:28:25.924
- Hurrah to our country - Hurrah to our country

431
00:28:25.924 --> 00:28:29.135
Until it's dry and worn out

432
00:28:29.135 --> 00:28:32.335
Do something about her? It's so embarrassing.

433
00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:34.335
- Are you ready? - Yes.

434
00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:35.474
- Are you having fun? - Yes.

435
00:28:35.474 --> 00:28:36.744
- Are you having fun? - Yes.

436
00:28:36.744 --> 00:28:39.144
Yes. Okay.

437
00:28:39.144 --> 00:28:40.615
- Listen carefully. - Hold on.

438
00:28:40.615 --> 00:28:43.845
Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Baekdusan Mountain are...

439
00:28:50.454 --> 00:28:51.525
Go and check on her.

440
00:28:52.055 --> 00:28:53.894
Hey, are you okay?

441
00:28:54.694 --> 00:28:55.694
Hey.

442
00:29:03.335 --> 00:29:04.365
What's going on?

443
00:29:10.805 --> 00:29:11.845
Eun ho?

444
00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:26.424
Let go of me.

445
00:29:26.424 --> 00:29:27.754
There's nothing wrong with that.

446
00:29:28.025 --> 00:29:30.625
You can get crazy when you are drunk.

447
00:29:31.325 --> 00:29:33.494
That's what most people would think.

448
00:29:33.635 --> 00:29:36.164
- What? - The rap you did earlier.

449
00:29:36.164 --> 00:29:38.734
Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Baekdusan Mountain are...

450
00:29:38.734 --> 00:29:40.974
That was so funny.

451
00:29:43.644 --> 00:29:44.904
I am sorry.

452
00:29:45.404 --> 00:29:46.944
I won't make fun of you.

453
00:29:48.075 --> 00:29:49.144
Yes!

454
00:29:50.444 --> 00:29:51.515
Stop it already.

455
00:29:54.355 --> 00:29:57.684
People won't see it weirdly...

456
00:29:57.684 --> 00:29:59.825
since you were just drunk.

457
00:30:00.855 --> 00:30:03.625
It's better than throwing up from the carriage like last time.

458
00:30:05.295 --> 00:30:06.595
Nothing.

459
00:30:06.595 --> 00:30:09.394
Why did Ju Ri appear?

460
00:30:09.595 --> 00:30:11.835
It's all because you like me so much.

461
00:30:13.474 --> 00:30:14.775
It's not good.

462
00:30:15.004 --> 00:30:18.174
You will fall in love with me deeper and deeper.

463
00:30:22.214 --> 00:30:23.214
Ye Ri.

464
00:30:26.914 --> 00:30:28.555
- More. - Here's more.

465
00:30:30.424 --> 00:30:31.484
You are so cute.

466
00:30:43.964 --> 00:30:44.964
Yes.

467
00:30:45.605 --> 00:30:48.704
Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Baekdusan Mountain are...

468
00:30:48.904 --> 00:30:50.004
There is Mr. Kim.

469
00:30:50.004 --> 00:30:54.144
Until the day when the East Sea's waters and Baekdusan Mountain are...

470
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:55.214
He's drunk.

471
00:30:55.674 --> 00:30:56.714
Yes.

472
00:30:59.144 --> 00:31:02.385
Until the day when the East Sea's... Go to your own bedrooms.

473
00:31:03.825 --> 00:31:06.355
Go to your own bedrooms.

474
00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:09.765
- Gosh. - Go to your own bedrooms.

475
00:31:10.394 --> 00:31:12.394
I told you to go to your own bedrooms.

476
00:31:12.865 --> 00:31:14.065
You should go.

477
00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:16.464
I should.

478
00:31:16.635 --> 00:31:18.504
You want to get something like this?

479
00:31:20.035 --> 00:31:21.674
- Yes. - He's drunk.

480
00:31:29.865 --> 00:31:32.565
What do you mean? It wasn't the police who came?

481
00:31:32.694 --> 00:31:34.565
On the day when your bike broke,

482
00:31:34.764 --> 00:31:37.504
Byung Cheol was in Daegu for his family ceremony.

483
00:31:38.804 --> 00:31:40.034
We have the evidence.

484
00:31:41.075 --> 00:31:42.145
And look.

485
00:31:44.974 --> 00:31:48.014
Byung Cheol was at a hospital for being sick at this time.

486
00:31:48.214 --> 00:31:49.784
We checked his record too.

487
00:31:50.385 --> 00:31:52.855
Who can it be?

488
00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:59.194
Do you know the bridge connected to the library on third floor?

489
00:31:59.524 --> 00:32:00.925
He came in from that way.

490
00:32:02.024 --> 00:32:05.095
You have to have a student's card to enter there.

491
00:32:06.065 --> 00:32:09.135
It means he might have entered from the library.

492
00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:24.159
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E06 Meloholic "Staying Close Together"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

493
00:32:36.095 --> 00:32:37.764
That's how he entered.

494
00:32:38.994 --> 00:32:40.065
It's likely...

495
00:32:41.534 --> 00:32:43.464
that the culprit studies at Eunha University.

496
00:32:45.234 --> 00:32:48.244
You two should be careful.

497
00:32:56.615 --> 00:32:57.714
Gosh.

498
00:33:39.454 --> 00:33:40.494
And?

499
00:33:42.465 --> 00:33:44.065
So you are saying...

500
00:33:44.165 --> 00:33:47.465
that you will stay here until we catch the culprit?

501
00:33:47.665 --> 00:33:48.935
No, sir.

502
00:33:49.835 --> 00:33:51.775
I will just rent a room.

503
00:33:51.775 --> 00:33:52.775
No.

504
00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:56.105
The police told us to stay close.

505
00:33:56.275 --> 00:33:59.145
He told us to be careful. He didn't mean us to stay close.

506
00:34:00.685 --> 00:34:01.744
Okay.

507
00:34:03.315 --> 00:34:04.384
One thing.

508
00:34:04.855 --> 00:34:05.954
There's nothing free.

509
00:34:07.284 --> 00:34:09.355
- Joo Seung. - Gosh.

510
00:34:09.454 --> 00:34:12.724
Thank you so much.

511
00:34:12.724 --> 00:34:14.795
- Let me go. - Is it okay for me to stay?

512
00:34:14.895 --> 00:34:15.994
Don't worry about it.

513
00:34:16.195 --> 00:34:19.335
Let me go. Please don't hug me.

514
00:34:19.764 --> 00:34:20.764
Don't worry.

515
00:34:21.065 --> 00:34:22.304
I am planning to...

516
00:34:22.304 --> 00:34:25.005
give you a lot of jobs while you stay at my house.

517
00:34:32.014 --> 00:34:33.715
Hey, hey

518
00:34:39.485 --> 00:34:40.554
Wash up.

519
00:34:49.924 --> 00:34:51.565
Alvin Toffler said this.

520
00:34:51.565 --> 00:34:52.994
"Korean students learn knowledge..."

521
00:34:52.994 --> 00:34:55.304
"that won't be necessary in the future."

522
00:34:55.304 --> 00:34:58.605
"They are wasting their precious time. They are all crazy."

523
00:34:58.605 --> 00:35:00.775
Do you even know who Alvin Toffler is?

524
00:35:01.344 --> 00:35:04.275
Are you really one of the top 10 students for mock exam?

525
00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.614
But why did you retake the exam for three years?

526
00:35:18.255 --> 00:35:19.525
(Test ID Slip)

527
00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:22.665
Students taking the exam get 50 percent off, right?

528
00:35:22.764 --> 00:35:24.594
Is the exam over already?

529
00:35:24.594 --> 00:35:25.994
It's only 1pm.

530
00:35:26.534 --> 00:35:28.634
I skipped it.

531
00:35:35.244 --> 00:35:38.074
Okay. The answer for this question is...

532
00:35:38.415 --> 00:35:40.145
hidden in this word.

533
00:35:40.884 --> 00:35:42.384
Which is the answer then?

534
00:35:44.384 --> 00:35:46.315
"Several"?

535
00:35:46.315 --> 00:35:48.625
Gosh. I didn't know there were such questions.

536
00:35:48.724 --> 00:35:51.324
I should take a photo of it and upload on my SNS.

537
00:35:51.324 --> 00:35:53.625
I will become famous on SNS.

538
00:35:58.364 --> 00:36:00.065
Shall we take a rest?

539
00:36:05.174 --> 00:36:06.304
"Several".

540
00:36:07.445 --> 00:36:08.904
This is my limit.

541
00:36:10.775 --> 00:36:11.815
Why?

542
00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:15.915
You said you saw it when you held her hand.

543
00:36:15.915 --> 00:36:17.585
Didn't you see why or when that started happening to her?

544
00:36:17.915 --> 00:36:19.985
Well, I didn't get to see that part.

545
00:36:22.485 --> 00:36:23.525
Ye Ri.

546
00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:30.295
Hey. Wake up.

547
00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:32.835
Are you shocked?

548
00:36:44.514 --> 00:36:46.945
- Hey. I am... - Yes?

549
00:36:48.545 --> 00:36:49.915
Nothing.

550
00:36:50.244 --> 00:36:51.614
Jerk.

551
00:36:51.784 --> 00:36:54.625
Anyway, Ye Ri went through a lot because of Ju Ri.

552
00:36:54.855 --> 00:36:58.324
Ju Ri did everything to make guys leave Ye Ri.

553
00:36:59.994 --> 00:37:00.994
Really?

554
00:37:03.594 --> 00:37:05.935
As I hear about it more and more,

555
00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:09.005
it's not that she has arrhenophobia.

Eun Ho.

561
00:38:28.614 --> 00:38:31.185
It was you. You called my name.

562
00:38:32.784 --> 00:38:33.855
I didn't call you.

563
00:38:34.824 --> 00:38:35.855
Never mind.

564
00:38:36.424 --> 00:38:38.494
I was having a nightmare.

565
00:38:39.154 --> 00:38:41.724
You called my name, so I could wake up.

566
00:38:41.994 --> 00:38:43.065
A nightmare?

567
00:38:53.605 --> 00:38:54.775
A nightmare.

568
00:38:55.474 --> 00:38:56.945
I get this same nightmare quite often.

569
00:38:57.275 --> 00:39:00.215
Do you mean you dream of the incident that happened...

570
00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:02.215
three years ago?

571
00:39:05.654 --> 00:39:07.224
Min Jung told me.

572
00:39:07.585 --> 00:39:10.954
What a jerk. He deserves a punishment.

573
00:39:19.895 --> 00:39:21.634
I heard this from somewhere.

574
00:39:22.165 --> 00:39:23.935
"Truth is like the sun."

575
00:39:24.134 --> 00:39:27.605
"You can shut it out for a time, but it won't go away."

576
00:39:28.474 --> 00:39:30.415
So I am saying that...

577
00:39:30.844 --> 00:39:32.744
you will be able to remember his face someday.

578
00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:35.915
He will get caught one day.

579
00:39:36.344 --> 00:39:37.554
And he will have to pay for what he has done.

580
00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:44.424
Ever since that day,

581
00:39:45.154 --> 00:39:47.395
I've hated holding people's hands.

582
00:39:49.565 --> 00:39:50.795
You are different.

583
00:39:51.864 --> 00:39:54.565
I can't help but to hold your hands.

584
00:39:55.005 --> 00:39:56.665
I can't stop myself from touching your hands.

585
00:39:59.304 --> 00:40:00.445
It's same for me.

586
00:40:04.744 --> 00:40:07.045

587
00:40:57.065 --> 00:40:58.695
Are you Ju Ri?

588
00:41:02.065 --> 00:41:03.134
You are so tasty.

589
00:41:06.174 --> 00:41:07.244
Good morning.

590
00:41:07.945 --> 00:41:08.945
Gosh.

591
00:41:13.545 --> 00:41:15.915
I like it here.

592
00:41:19.384 --> 00:41:20.884
What's going on?

593
00:41:20.884 --> 00:41:23.695
Oh my gosh. Unbelievable.

594
00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:25.755
These are new editions.

595
00:41:26.424 --> 00:41:28.724
I love this place.

596
00:41:33.335 --> 00:41:36.804
Did you say your parents are living abroad?

597
00:41:37.074 --> 00:41:38.074
America?

598
00:41:38.074 --> 00:41:39.204
Yes.

599
00:41:39.804 --> 00:41:40.945
America.

600
00:41:43.145 --> 00:41:45.715
Does this house belong to...

601
00:41:48.185 --> 00:41:49.884
- you? - "You"?

602
00:41:50.685 --> 00:41:52.985
- Don't smile. - I wasn't smiling.

603
00:41:54.025 --> 00:41:55.185
This is also new.

604
00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:02.494
Hey.

605
00:42:03.634 --> 00:42:05.634
She's very different.

606
00:42:07.105 --> 00:42:08.435
Why did this happen though?

607
00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:11.275
We were... No. Nothing.

608
00:42:11.474 --> 00:42:13.034
I don't know.

609
00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:15.005
Ju Ri. Give Ye Ri back.

610
00:42:18.045 --> 00:42:19.844
No. I want to be with you.

611
00:42:19.915 --> 00:42:22.215
I missed you a lot.

612
00:42:23.514 --> 00:42:24.554
Whatever.

613
00:42:24.855 --> 00:42:26.685
Let go. You have to go back in.

614
00:42:26.685 --> 00:42:28.755
- I don't want to. - You must.

615
00:42:30.795 --> 00:42:33.224
- Bye, honey. - Bye.

616
00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.594
Did something happen? Do we have an ambulance?

617
00:42:42.605 --> 00:42:45.174
You are crazy.

618
00:42:45.174 --> 00:42:47.904
Let me sleep.

619
00:42:48.174 --> 00:42:50.174
It looks delicious.

620
00:42:52.574 --> 00:42:53.614
It's tasty.

621
00:42:54.244 --> 00:42:55.344
I love this.

622
00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:57.384
I think this place is famous for this.

623
00:42:58.884 --> 00:43:01.355
This is so delicious, right?

624
00:43:15.864 --> 00:43:17.235
I am spending a lot of money.

625
00:43:18.404 --> 00:43:20.674
Stop eating.

626
00:43:20.844 --> 00:43:21.904
It's not your body.

627
00:43:22.204 --> 00:43:23.614
Let go.

628
00:43:24.415 --> 00:43:27.715
I don't know when I can come out again. I should eat when I can.

629
00:43:28.384 --> 00:43:30.185
I can't believe I let this happen.

630
00:43:35.324 --> 00:43:38.695
It seemed like you were enjoying it a lot. Now tell me.

631
00:43:39.295 --> 00:43:43.264
Did you enjoy doing it with Ye Ri or with me?

632
00:43:45.534 --> 00:43:48.034
- You better be quiet. - What?

633
00:43:48.665 --> 00:43:50.704
How do you know that though?

634
00:43:52.235 --> 00:43:54.005
I am different from Ye Ri.

635
00:43:54.005 --> 00:43:57.474
Even when I'm not out, I can see what she's up to.

636
00:43:58.474 --> 00:43:59.715
Everything.

637
00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:05.215
Why do you like such a stubborn girl?

638
00:44:05.485 --> 00:44:06.685
Leave her.

639
00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:09.054
Even if you try to make us break up,

640
00:44:09.054 --> 00:44:11.424
- I will never break up with her. - Go out with me.

641
00:44:12.195 --> 00:44:15.594
It will be much more fun if you go out with me.

642
00:44:15.764 --> 00:44:17.735
What? Ju Ri.

643
00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:20.165
I love it.

644
00:44:21.505 --> 00:44:22.565
I love it.

645
00:44:23.404 --> 00:44:26.275
I love it when you call...

646
00:44:26.674 --> 00:44:27.904
my name.

647
00:44:31.145 --> 00:44:32.145
No.

648
00:44:36.545 --> 00:44:38.454
- Are you okay, Ju Ri? - Yes.

649
00:44:40.755 --> 00:44:43.585
I will kill you if you hurt her.

650
00:44:48.424 --> 00:44:49.665
I think...

651
00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:52.235
I started having feelings for you from that night.

652
00:44:54.304 --> 00:44:55.335
You should do something about it.

653
00:45:00.474 --> 00:45:03.945
I should eat him before Ye Ri does.

654
00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:09.744
What's wrong?

655
00:45:12.014 --> 00:45:13.284
What's wrong?

656
00:45:14.824 --> 00:45:17.724
She eats so well.

657
00:45:19.324 --> 00:45:21.665
There's another person inside of me.

658
00:45:24.534 --> 00:45:26.534
You should do something about my feelings for you.

659
00:45:28.034 --> 00:45:29.935
You should catch me.

660
00:45:30.974 --> 00:45:32.034
Hey.

661
00:45:37.775 --> 00:45:39.744
No. It's not what you guys think.

662
00:45:39.744 --> 00:45:42.114
You got it wrong.

663
00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:44.054
I'm not that kind of a person.

664
00:45:47.355 --> 00:45:48.384
Good.

665
00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:50.795
I love this.

666
00:45:51.724 --> 00:45:52.724
Gosh.

667
00:45:53.395 --> 00:45:54.625
This is my style.

668
00:45:55.264 --> 00:45:58.034
This is so sexy. I should wear this next time when I go clubbing.

669
00:46:01.965 --> 00:46:03.165
This is Ye Ri's.

670
00:46:05.235 --> 00:46:07.105
Oh my gosh.

671
00:46:12.344 --> 00:46:13.344
I love this.

672
00:46:37.835 --> 00:46:39.875
I will take these.

673
00:46:42.045 --> 00:46:45.045
What? Are you going to buy them all? Do you have money?

674
00:46:45.045 --> 00:46:46.074
I have money.

675
00:46:47.545 --> 00:46:49.114
- Here's my card. - Yes.

676
00:46:49.485 --> 00:46:50.985
This is Ye Ri's.

677
00:46:52.154 --> 00:46:55.224
Ye Ri's money is mine, and Ye Ri's clothes are mine too.

678
00:46:55.424 --> 00:46:56.454
Here's my card.

679
00:46:56.784 --> 00:46:57.855
Sorry.

680
00:46:58.525 --> 00:47:00.665
We will only take this one.

681
00:47:03.935 --> 00:47:05.965
Ye Ri wants to buy these.

682
00:47:06.264 --> 00:47:09.065
Ju Ri wants these.

683
00:47:09.065 --> 00:47:11.674
Please let me buy these.

684
00:47:13.074 --> 00:47:16.244
No. How would Ye Ri feel when she finds out about this?

685
00:47:16.244 --> 00:47:18.514
She can't even work because of you.

686
00:47:18.815 --> 00:47:21.715
Just take this one. It suits you.

687
00:47:22.014 --> 00:47:23.344
This is unbelievable.

688
00:47:27.284 --> 00:47:29.454
Okay. I will buy it for you.

689
00:47:30.395 --> 00:47:33.424
So please just go back in, okay?

690
00:47:34.424 --> 00:47:37.065
Thank you, Eun Ho.

691
00:47:37.795 --> 00:47:39.094
Buy me something else too.

692
00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:40.605
No.

693
00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:43.105
Sorry.

694
00:47:43.605 --> 00:47:45.775
Can we also take that one?

695
00:47:47.204 --> 00:47:50.445
That one? It's so pretty.

696
00:47:52.945 --> 00:47:54.284
That's for Ye Ri.

697
00:47:55.085 --> 00:47:56.685
It looks good on me too.

698
00:47:57.614 --> 00:47:58.715
It sure does.

699
00:47:59.454 --> 00:48:01.384
I love these.

700
00:48:01.985 --> 00:48:03.355
Don't you know it?

701
00:48:03.355 --> 00:48:05.295
Is there someone else who would do such thing other than Byung Cheol?

702
00:48:06.154 --> 00:48:09.724
I don't know. Young Chul? Min Ho?

703
00:48:10.494 --> 00:48:11.594
Eun Sung?

704
00:48:13.165 --> 00:48:14.235
Can it be...

705
00:48:15.404 --> 00:48:16.404
David?

706
00:48:17.074 --> 00:48:19.634
Who is David?

707
00:48:20.304 --> 00:48:22.804
There isn't anyone who would do such thing.

708
00:48:23.074 --> 00:48:25.674
How about your disappeared ex-boyfriend?

709
00:48:27.445 --> 00:48:30.014
What if he came back to be with you?

710
00:48:30.014 --> 00:48:31.784
But then he saw me next to you, so he got jealous.

711
00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:35.284
Kim Sun Ho can't hurt Ye Ri.

712
00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:37.154
Never.

713
00:48:37.594 --> 00:48:39.695
Sun Ho? Is that his name?

714
00:48:41.324 --> 00:48:42.465
I'm going to the bathroom.

715
00:48:44.335 --> 00:48:46.065
What's wrong with her?

716
00:48:47.435 --> 00:48:48.935
Are you saying he's different from others?

717
00:48:50.264 --> 00:48:51.674
I'm jealous now.

718
00:48:58.415 --> 00:49:00.014
It can't be Sun Ho.

719
00:49:01.085 --> 00:49:02.485
Because he...

720
00:49:47.094 --> 00:49:48.625
What's wrong? Did you throw up?

721
00:49:48.924 --> 00:49:51.634
I told you to stop eating.

722
00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:56.304
Ye Ri.

723
00:49:56.764 --> 00:49:59.674
You're back. Are you okay?

724
00:50:00.605 --> 00:50:01.674
Eun Ho.

725
00:50:02.674 --> 00:50:04.474
I don't feel well.

726
00:50:20.895 --> 00:50:22.864
You have an upset stomach.

727
00:50:23.695 --> 00:50:24.795
You ate...

728
00:50:25.235 --> 00:50:28.005
Ju Ri ate a lot earlier.

729
00:50:28.264 --> 00:50:29.264
Okay.

730
00:50:31.335 --> 00:50:34.445
You two spent the whole day today then.

731
00:50:35.445 --> 00:50:37.215
Yes. We did.

732
00:50:37.574 --> 00:50:40.045
I was watching her because she might cause trouble.

733
00:50:40.614 --> 00:50:41.884
Didn't she irritate you?

734
00:50:42.315 --> 00:50:44.954
I am sure she did everything she could to make you leave me.

735
00:50:46.154 --> 00:50:47.154
Right.

736
00:50:47.755 --> 00:50:48.954
I think...

737
00:50:51.424 --> 00:50:54.764
I started having feelings for you from that night.

738
00:50:56.994 --> 00:50:58.094
You should do something about it.

739
00:51:00.665 --> 00:51:01.804
What?

740
00:51:02.665 --> 00:51:04.574
Nothing happened.

741
00:51:05.074 --> 00:51:06.505
This won't work.

742
00:51:06.505 --> 00:51:08.904
It seems like you need some medication.

743
00:51:08.904 --> 00:51:11.244
- I am fine now. - No.

744
00:51:11.545 --> 00:51:13.514
You will be in pain in your sleep.

745
00:51:13.945 --> 00:51:15.085
I will be back soon.

746
00:51:19.985 --> 00:51:21.025
Where are you going?

747
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.954
Get me some rice cakes. I want to have them while studying.

748
00:51:30.994 --> 00:51:32.034
Hi.

749
00:51:35.264 --> 00:51:36.264
She's so mean.

750
00:51:36.465 --> 00:51:37.674
It hurts.

751
00:51:49.415 --> 00:51:50.454
It's raining.

752
00:52:13.034 --> 00:52:14.704
It's so pretty.

753
00:52:16.145 --> 00:52:17.174
Hey.

754
00:52:17.815 --> 00:52:19.315
Can't I borrow this once?

755
00:52:20.514 --> 00:52:22.384
You can borrow something else.

756
00:52:22.645 --> 00:52:23.685
Not this one though.

757
00:52:24.855 --> 00:52:26.654
I was only asking.

758
00:52:27.224 --> 00:52:29.554
I will look nice in it.

759
00:52:32.724 --> 00:52:33.795
Who is it?

760
00:52:33.994 --> 00:52:35.864
Is there someone you like?

761
00:52:37.534 --> 00:52:38.594
Is he from your school?

762
00:52:39.235 --> 00:52:41.505
I don't hang out with those childish guys.

763
00:52:42.605 --> 00:52:43.735
There's someone.

764
00:52:44.204 --> 00:52:46.335
He's very mysterious.

765
00:52:48.904 --> 00:52:51.474
You should introduce him to me one day.

766
00:52:52.045 --> 00:52:53.114
I will see.

767
00:52:56.384 --> 00:52:57.485
Hey.

768
00:52:58.654 --> 00:53:02.424
But shouldn't Eun Ho be wearing that necklace?

769
00:53:02.585 --> 00:53:03.585
What?

770
00:53:16.134 --> 00:53:19.704
The bike incident and the locker incident...

771
00:53:20.674 --> 00:53:22.574
were meant to attack Eun Ho.

772
00:53:23.614 --> 00:53:26.815
The stalker is trying to hurt Eun Ho.

773
00:53:27.645 --> 00:53:28.915
Not you.

774
00:53:42.665 --> 00:53:45.335
This shortcut is so dark.

775
00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:47.735
Why is there no light?

776
00:54:06.384 --> 00:54:07.454
I got you.

777
00:54:09.284 --> 00:54:10.295
Who are you?

778
00:54:32.474 --> 00:54:35.985
(Meloholic)

779
00:54:38.784 --> 00:54:39.855
I like you.

780
00:54:40.014 --> 00:54:43.185
Eun Ho likes Ju Ri.

781
00:54:43.485 --> 00:54:45.824
I am not cheating.

782
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:47.165
It is cheating.

783
00:54:47.165 --> 00:54:49.994
You should tell me that you want to be with me, not Ye Ri.

784
00:54:50.795 --> 00:54:54.605
I hate feeling jealous of her.

785
00:54:54.764 --> 00:54:57.435
Yes. It was Sun Ho.

786
00:54:57.974 --> 00:54:59.904
He's the murderer.

787
00:55:01.474 --> 00:55:02.744
Just wait a little longer.

788
00:55:04.674 --> 00:55:05.875
I will find the owner.

789
00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:08.585
I should stop him from finding Sun Ho.

790
00:55:08.585 --> 00:55:10.485
Otherwise, Ye Ri and I will be done.

791
00:55:10.485 --> 00:55:11.715
Where is Sun Ho?
