00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:09.222
(Episode 13)

4
00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:29.781
Thank you.

5
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.921
The Prime Minister is coming.

6
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:46.392
What is this mess?

7
00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:48.262
My apologies, sir.

8
00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:50.002
You said to keep it confidential, so...

9
00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:09.252
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:13.521
Please move.

11
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:14.821
Sorry.

12
00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:24.901
Go and take care of it.

13
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.071
Prime Minister,

14
00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:44.442
your shot was amazing.

15
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:47.052
You shine in politics and in golf.

16
00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:49.682
You're so good at everything.

17
00:02:49.722 --> 00:02:53.092
My family has been talented for generations.

18
00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:58.391
Since your grandson will become a special...

19
00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:00.131
scholarship student at Hankuk University,

20
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.361
this means we'll all be from the same school.

21
00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:05.062
I can see that things will work out well...

22
00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:07.402
since we're from the same school.

23
00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:10.772
Thank you for all your efforts...

24
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.872
in helping our campus.

25
00:03:13.272 --> 00:03:15.571
Like I said, it's conditional...

26
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:16.881
although it's almost ready.

27
00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:20.052
The rest is up to Mayor Cho's luck.

28
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:24.381
- You should go. - Okay.

29
00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:31.722
This one?

30
00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:35.462
- Your form is good. - Yes.

31
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.361
Keep it like that.

32
00:03:40.932 --> 00:03:42.571
Nice shot!

33
00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:46.611
It's a hole-in-one.

34
00:03:49.742 --> 00:03:51.342
Congratulations, Mayor Cho.

35
00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:54.212
I hear this will make you lucky for three years.

36
00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:57.321
Mayor Cho, looks like you have to treat us.

37
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.692
There's no doubt about it.

38
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:02.752
I'll host you on a full course...

39
00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:05.462
for today and the next round too.

40
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.201
By the way, your shot was just as good.

41
00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:17.942
Get a full shot.

42
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:32.951
Ms. Ma.

43
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:39.792
Good work.

44
00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.562
Well, I always do a good job.

45
00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:46.872
You suit being a cooperating attorney.

46
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:49.502
I look forward to working with you again.

47
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:52.742
I doubt we'll be working together again.

48
00:04:53.612 --> 00:04:56.281
You must be mistaken.

49
00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:59.211
I don't like helping others.

50
00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:02.312
I help you, then you get all the credit.

51
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.622
All I get is a few hundred dollars.

52
00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:06.922
Then what will you do now?

53
00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:08.552
One moment.

54
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:11.192
- Yes, ma'am. - Where are you?

55
00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:12.662
I'm coming to the office now.

56
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:16.261
What do you think? I'll be a prosecutor.

57
00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:18.602
You just wait.

58
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.771
I'll come back as a prosecutor...

59
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:22.571
and become your senior.

60
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.742
I'll change your easygoing mind.

61
00:05:27.942 --> 00:05:29.942
Okay. I'll wait.

62
00:05:37.622 --> 00:05:42.651
(Witch's Court)

63
00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:04.281
Recording.

64
00:06:50.122 --> 00:06:51.221
Here.

65
00:07:01.102 --> 00:07:02.531
Seriously.

66
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:14.711
Give it to me.

67
00:07:26.492 --> 00:07:27.831
What's wrong with this?

68
00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:30.732
Hey. Do your job properly.

69
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:32.971
I told you to check on the scanner before.

70
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.002
- I'm sorry. - Jin Yun Hee.

71
00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:56.391
You...

72
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:04.162
dropped one of your earrings.

73
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.672
- I see. - There's jewelry inside.

74
00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:11.971
You should change them.

75
00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:14.571
Okay.

76
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.281
Sir.

77
00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:32.591
Marks don't mean anything.

78
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:34.932
Just looking at the family is enough.

79
00:08:36.402 --> 00:08:39.302
To have your grandson enroll...

80
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.942
is an honor for Hankuk University.

81
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.341
What do you think?

82
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:45.971
Of course.

83
00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:49.012
Like Hyungjae Group's Ahn Tae Kyoo...

84
00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:51.111
and the daughter of Chief Secretary Min,

85
00:08:51.882 --> 00:08:53.652
the children of great families...

86
00:08:53.652 --> 00:08:55.412
are making the school shine.

87
00:08:55.782 --> 00:08:59.081
Thanks to that, we were able to revamp...

88
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:01.422
the school gym and the auditorium.

89
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.861
South Korea is such a great country.

90
00:09:06.062 --> 00:09:08.132
By helping each other,

91
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:10.302
we're making developments.

92
00:09:11.762 --> 00:09:13.402
On that note,

93
00:09:13.871 --> 00:09:15.772
I'm thinking of extending...

94
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.542
the school to Yeongpa.

95
00:09:18.971 --> 00:09:21.971
Are you talking about a new campus?

96
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:23.312
Yes.

97
00:09:25.012 --> 00:09:27.751
If Juyoung-dong will give the permission,

98
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:29.922
I would give...

99
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:32.221
full support.

100
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:34.221
Juyoung-dong in Yeongpa?

101
00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:36.922
The Ministry of Land and the Ministry...

102
00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:39.762
of National Defense will be against it.

103
00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:45.231
That's why we're bringing it up.

104
00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:49.772
If Hyungjae Group's White Town development...

105
00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:51.601
sets in place near the school,

106
00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:55.071
we'll be able to service...

107
00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:57.542
even your grandchild's grandchild.

108
00:09:57.912 --> 00:09:59.882
My grandchild's grandchild?

109
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:03.351
That sounds sweet to my ears.

110
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.351
Here, let's drink.

111
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.991
Yes.

112
00:10:09.022 --> 00:10:11.991
Hey. Don't get mad about something like this.

113
00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:14.831
- I'll buy you chicken. - Forget it.

114
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:17.062
- Stop being mad. - Let me go.

115
00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:43.621
Gosh.

116
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.721
Why would he tell me on his way home?

117
00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:47.262
I told him to do his job properly.

118
00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:50.662
Not everyone can become the chief.

119
00:10:50.861 --> 00:10:54.371
Gosh. Chief, this. Chief, that.

120
00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:59.241
What would they do without me?

121
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:10.652
Yes.

122
00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:13.192
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:14.991
Okay.

124
00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:45.652
His secret to connections is simple.

125
00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:47.091
He hires women for them and lobbies them.

126
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:49.461
He gets people on his side by providing...

127
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:51.292
women of their tastes and by throwing money.

128
00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:52.991
That's very like him.

129
00:11:53.262 --> 00:11:54.562
Even if we get him arrested for that,

130
00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:56.361
it will only be seen as a compulsion.

131
00:11:56.802 --> 00:11:59.571
Shouldn't we chase after his money?

132
00:11:59.731 --> 00:12:00.731
No.

133
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.741
(2004 Cheong-Ungag Sexual Favors Issue)

134
00:12:03.741 --> 00:12:04.841
Cheong-Ungag?

135
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:07.241
This is the case that made Cho what he is today.

136
00:12:07.772 --> 00:12:11.012
In 2004 when Cho was a commissioner general,

137
00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:14.951
Baek Sang Ho received bribes from hostess bars.

138
00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.081
With that money, they made a slush fund...

139
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.751
and found a place they can lobby.

140
00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:20.951
That's how Cho...

141
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.062
became a member of the National Assembly.

142
00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:25.721
So ever since 2004, Cho grew bigger...

143
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:28.392
by providing women and lobbying?

144
00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:30.361
That's right.

145
00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:33.272
He made a space just like Cheong-Ungag...

146
00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:36.442
and is providing sexual favors to high figures.

147
00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:39.071
I'm going to put together a list of the regulars...

148
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:40.471
along with the evidence...

149
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:42.642
to arrest Cho Gap Soo.

150
00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:44.841
A lobbying space?

151
00:12:46.512 --> 00:12:47.751
Where is that?

152
00:12:48.111 --> 00:12:49.312
It's Kingdom.

153
00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:55.991
You're Ms. Min's secret agent.

154
00:12:57.461 --> 00:12:59.361
(Jin Sul Hee)

155
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:00.461
I'm that woman's...

156
00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:03.262
younger sister.

157
00:13:04.831 --> 00:13:06.132
Her name is Jin Yun Hee.

158
00:13:07.132 --> 00:13:08.672
She has the same goal as we do.

159
00:13:11.272 --> 00:13:13.211
How do you know about Kingdom?

160
00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:16.241
Because I've been there already.

161
00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:20.251
Hyungjae Hotel, level K.

162
00:13:21.512 --> 00:13:22.652
Level K?

163
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:24.782
Level K?

164
00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:27.351
(You have one new voicemail.)

165
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:28.351
(Voicemail)

166
00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:33.692
Hey, can you come save me?

167
00:13:33.861 --> 00:13:35.432
I'm at Hyungjae Hotel's K...

168
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:39.062
That's where Kong Soo Ah's incident happened.

169
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.432
Did you know already?

170
00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:45.871
I only found out recently.

171
00:13:46.142 --> 00:13:48.012
After Yun Hee penetrated Kingdom.

172
00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:50.812
Had we known earlier,

173
00:13:50.841 --> 00:13:53.052
we could have taken care of Kong Soo Ah's case.

174
00:13:54.382 --> 00:13:55.412
Lobbying, sexual favors,

175
00:13:55.412 --> 00:13:57.052
and concealing a murder?

176
00:13:57.382 --> 00:13:59.692
All of Cho's weaknesses are there.

177
00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:03.062
I witnessed one of them last night.

178
00:14:10.562 --> 00:14:11.902
It's recorded on this.

179
00:14:23.942 --> 00:14:24.942
Here.

180
00:14:26.912 --> 00:14:29.412
I couldn't get anything for a while,

181
00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:31.022
so I thought I was wasting time.

182
00:14:31.382 --> 00:14:33.351
But I found something bigger than I expected.

183
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:36.861
He's Kim Ho Kyung.

184
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:38.562
The chancellor of Hankuk University.

185
00:14:39.961 --> 00:14:41.692
You know him, right? The Prime Minister.

186
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:46.272
He's involved in illicit admissions.

187
00:14:46.932 --> 00:14:49.272
He's acting as the broker between...

188
00:14:49.272 --> 00:14:51.001
high-ranking officials and Hankuk University.

189
00:14:53.312 --> 00:14:54.711
Illicit admissions?

190
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:58.211
If I keep tailing him, we'll get something.

191
00:14:59.012 --> 00:15:00.012
Right.

192
00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:02.922
Here.

193
00:15:04.621 --> 00:15:07.152
Do you see the reflection of the car?

194
00:15:07.951 --> 00:15:11.522
I met with the owner for the dash cam footage.

195
00:15:12.562 --> 00:15:13.562
However,

196
00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:16.501
someone asked to buy it, so they sold it.

197
00:15:17.201 --> 00:15:18.361
They sold it?

198
00:15:20.272 --> 00:15:22.032
Could it be Ms. Ma?

199
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:24.902
She's investigating Baek Sang Ho's death.

200
00:15:25.241 --> 00:15:27.371
No, I don't think it's her.

201
00:15:27.542 --> 00:15:29.782
She would have met with Baek Min Ho first.

202
00:15:32.981 --> 00:15:36.682
That means someone wants to cover up...

203
00:15:36.682 --> 00:15:39.081
Baek Sang Ho's death.

204
00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:41.721
Could it be Cho Gap Soo?

205
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.192
Mr. Yeo, Jung Young Ho got arrested.

206
00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:51.001
He was handed over to Mr. Koo...

207
00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:52.632
from the Immigration Office.

208
00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:03.882
Who is he?

209
00:16:04.442 --> 00:16:06.581
He's the researcher from NFS that forged...

210
00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:07.951
the evidence for Kong Soo Ah's case.

211
00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:09.052
Is that so?

212
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:11.152
Great.

213
00:16:11.422 --> 00:16:14.022
Jin Wook looks even more handsome in there.

214
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:15.621
He's sexy.

215
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:19.491
Jung Young Ho.

216
00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:24.101
Do you admit that you forged...

217
00:16:24.302 --> 00:16:25.762
the analysis report for Kong Soo Ah's case?

218
00:16:26.062 --> 00:16:28.231
No. I don't know anything about this.

219
00:16:28.772 --> 00:16:31.201
This is the statement from Lee Sang Joon,

220
00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:32.871
the researcher in charge of DNA testing at NFS.

221
00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:34.542
He said that the knuckle...

222
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:36.942
was never asked to be analyzed.

223
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.211
We were also able to restore the report...

224
00:16:42.211 --> 00:16:44.152
you deleted from your computer.

225
00:16:44.152 --> 00:16:45.721
(Restored files from Jung Young Ho's computer)

226
00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:47.692
Just before handing in your resignation letter,

227
00:16:47.851 --> 00:16:51.392
you received 200,000 dollars to your account.

228
00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:53.692
(200,000 dollars)

229
00:16:53.692 --> 00:16:56.831
Are you still going to say you don't know anything?

230
00:17:00.371 --> 00:17:01.632
Who hired you?

231
00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:11.442
I was hiding abroad,

232
00:17:11.642 --> 00:17:12.981
so I couldn't be here...

233
00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:15.382
for my father's passing.

234
00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:18.152
I want to stay with him for his funeral.

235
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:21.822
Please get me indictment without detention.

236
00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:26.061
Then I'll volunteer to turn myself in.

237
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:34.332
I told you, didn't I?

238
00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:37.271
We need to find another way to get the list.

239
00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:39.471
I told you not to go there as a hostess!

240
00:17:39.511 --> 00:17:40.711
What should I do then?

241
00:17:41.572 --> 00:17:44.311
Can we arrest Cho with the list?

242
00:17:44.842 --> 00:17:45.882
We have to get inside...

243
00:17:45.882 --> 00:17:48.682
to get real evidence of their wrongdoings.

244
00:17:48.682 --> 00:17:50.521
Even still.

245
00:17:50.951 --> 00:17:53.092
How can you go...

246
00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:55.622
to entertain Park Myung Il?

247
00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:57.092
What else can I do?

248
00:17:57.892 --> 00:17:59.362
Do you have another idea?

249
00:17:59.832 --> 00:18:02.192
If you do, tell me.

250
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:08.201
Get out.

251
00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:09.741
I don't need your evidence,

252
00:18:09.741 --> 00:18:10.942
so take it and leave.

253
00:18:11.172 --> 00:18:12.172
Ms. Min.

254
00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:14.471
Go do whatever you want!

255
00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:18.511
Ms. Min, but...

256
00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:23.582
- Where are you going? - Yes.

257
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:28.551
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:33.251 --> 00:19:34.852
I did it because I couldn't think...

259
00:19:35.852 --> 00:19:38.392
of any other way to catch him.

260
00:19:44.432 --> 00:19:45.561
So...

261
00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:49.402
please catch him this time.

262
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:53.741
Never act on your own without my order.

263
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.572
Can you promise me?

264
00:19:58.011 --> 00:19:59.011
Yes.

265
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:05.981
You two are okay now, right?

266
00:20:06.152 --> 00:20:08.721
Can we listen to this first?

267
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:13.791
Choi Yong Woon, the scanner can break.

268
00:20:13.932 --> 00:20:16.031
Why did you embarrass me in front of a woman?

269
00:20:16.092 --> 00:20:17.832
What? Hey.

270
00:20:18.332 --> 00:20:20.832
I told you to call me a chief at work.

271
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:22.132
We're not at home.

272
00:20:22.132 --> 00:20:24.142
Chief, my foot.

273
00:20:24.442 --> 00:20:26.711
If I was the one who passed on the video,

274
00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:28.372
I would be in your position!

275
00:20:28.372 --> 00:20:29.372
Hey!

276
00:20:29.882 --> 00:20:31.942
I told you not to talk about the video.

277
00:20:32.582 --> 00:20:33.751
If Cho Gap Soo finds out,

278
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:35.451
he'll kill us both!

279
00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:36.922
Watch your mouth, okay?

280
00:20:37.082 --> 00:20:38.182
Pay attention.

281
00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:44.422
We got the statement from NFS...

282
00:20:45.221 --> 00:20:47.632
admitting that the evidence was forged.

283
00:20:48.362 --> 00:20:49.701
Both you and Ahn Tae Kyoo...

284
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:52.231
don't have any evidence left.

285
00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:54.902
We have to start from the beginning.

286
00:20:57.572 --> 00:20:59.942
You mentioned Ahn Tae Kyoo's video.

287
00:21:01.172 --> 00:21:03.642
We can flip this case around if we have that.

288
00:21:04.842 --> 00:21:07.551
Do you know where it could be?

289
00:21:07.951 --> 00:21:10.382
Or do you know anyone who might have taken it?

290
00:21:10.882 --> 00:21:13.422
- If you can... - How can I trust you?

291
00:21:15.652 --> 00:21:18.021
I can't trust anyone right now.

292
00:21:19.322 --> 00:21:21.132
Even my brother, whom I trusted,

293
00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:24.001
died while trying to resolve my case.

294
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:26.932
I won't give up.

295
00:21:27.801 --> 00:21:29.902
I'll set right everything that went wrong.

296
00:21:32.572 --> 00:21:34.741
I have nothing else to say.

297
00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:40.882
We don't have much time.

298
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:43.582
If you think of anything,

299
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:45.751
tell me before the statute of limitations expires.

300
00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:00.701
I went to your brother's house to find the video,

301
00:22:02.172 --> 00:22:04.201
but Cho Gap Soo got rid of the house.

302
00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:25.021
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:31.662
I'm the one...

304
00:22:32.402 --> 00:22:33.872
who did that...

305
00:22:35.132 --> 00:22:36.142
to Sang Ho.

306
00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:39.872
That prosecutor, Ma Yi Deum,

307
00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:44.481
was holding a grudge against me.

308
00:22:45.382 --> 00:22:48.711
I should've nipped it in the bud,

309
00:22:50.221 --> 00:22:51.682
I failed to do that,

310
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:55.021
so it's my fault.

311
00:22:57.491 --> 00:22:59.261
Once we appeal,

312
00:22:59.491 --> 00:23:01.261
your sentence will be shortened.

313
00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:03.561
Suffer...

314
00:23:04.932 --> 00:23:06.301
just a little longer.

315
00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:09.701
When you get out,

316
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:11.672
you need to fill in for Sang Ho.

317
00:23:13.872 --> 00:23:17.811
That way, he could relax up above.

318
00:23:22.281 --> 00:23:23.281
What happened...

319
00:23:24.481 --> 00:23:26.122
to our house...

320
00:23:27.122 --> 00:23:28.551
and my brother's things?

321
00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:38.862
Don't worry about a thing.

322
00:23:39.362 --> 00:23:41.102
I kept everything as is.

323
00:23:41.902 --> 00:23:44.172
Your house and your brother's things.

324
00:23:44.842 --> 00:23:46.572
They're all being kept safe.

325
00:23:50.942 --> 00:23:54.051
I need to tell the prosecutor something.

326
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:56.221
Your visit is over. Go in.

327
00:24:00.692 --> 00:24:02.291
They said a video, right?

328
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:04.092
That's what I heard.

329
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:07.961
So they gave the original to Cho Gap Soo.

330
00:24:07.961 --> 00:24:09.501
If he gave an obedient thug...

331
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.362
the title of chief,

332
00:24:11.731 --> 00:24:14.332
the video has something that can destroy him.

333
00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:16.902
It may be quicker...

334
00:24:16.902 --> 00:24:18.642
to get the video than the lobby list.

335
00:24:18.642 --> 00:24:20.412
We need to find out where it is first.

336
00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:23.912
Carefully approach Choi Yong Woon.

337
00:24:24.142 --> 00:24:25.481
Not him.

338
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:26.682
I already tried,

339
00:24:26.682 --> 00:24:28.281
but he's suspicious of others, so I gave up.

340
00:24:29.981 --> 00:24:30.981
Okay.

341
00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:33.152
Then I'll meet Dong Shik.

342
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:35.192
- You will? - Naturally.

343
00:24:35.192 --> 00:24:36.692
I'm gifted...

344
00:24:36.922 --> 00:24:38.692
at seducing men.

345
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.291
What was that?

346
00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:41.461
Dong Shik.

347
00:24:41.761 --> 00:24:43.162
He'll be mine soon.

348
00:25:28.511 --> 00:25:30.382
You little punk.

349
00:25:47.392 --> 00:25:48.392
Fruit platter please.

350
00:25:52.201 --> 00:25:53.201
Excuse me.

351
00:25:53.572 --> 00:25:54.572
Yes?

352
00:25:56.342 --> 00:25:57.872
I'd like to give him this.

353
00:25:58.842 --> 00:25:59.912
This?

354
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:01.142
Yes.

355
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:03.041
His glass is empty. Go on.

356
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:04.041
Okay.

357
00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:11.882
What's this?

358
00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:13.692
She sent it.

359
00:27:16.852 --> 00:27:19.082
You should drink with me, considering all my effort.

360
00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:21.491
Check, please.

361
00:27:24.422 --> 00:27:26.021
This is humiliating.

362
00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:27.561
Why doesn't he like me?

363
00:27:35.672 --> 00:27:36.872
Come on.

364
00:27:36.902 --> 00:27:38.771
I said let's have a drink.

365
00:27:39.072 --> 00:27:40.412
What's wrong with you?

366
00:27:40.412 --> 00:27:41.642
Dong Shik?

367
00:27:47.182 --> 00:27:48.281
Yun Hee.

368
00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:52.182
I have a girlfriend.

369
00:27:52.251 --> 00:27:54.021
A girlfriend? Her?

370
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:56.221
- Let's go. - Sweetie,

371
00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:58.021
who's that old lady?

372
00:27:58.192 --> 00:28:00.261
Are you cheating on me?

373
00:28:00.332 --> 00:28:01.332
What?

374
00:28:01.362 --> 00:28:03.632
What do you mean? I have standards.

375
00:28:03.662 --> 00:28:05.231
She's a crazy woman. Let's go.

376
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:08.001
Yes, he is cheating!

377
00:28:08.001 --> 00:28:10.001
That liar. He was saying how much he liked me.

378
00:28:10.001 --> 00:28:11.172
He kissed me too.

379
00:28:11.172 --> 00:28:13.412
Babe! I said let's have another drink.

380
00:28:13.412 --> 00:28:15.342
I don't look so bad today.

381
00:28:15.342 --> 00:28:16.811
Ms. Ma?

382
00:28:19.182 --> 00:28:21.011
You have the wrong person.

383
00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:24.451
Wait. It really is you.

384
00:28:24.922 --> 00:28:27.051
It is you, Ms. Ma.

385
00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:33.632
You know, I believe all jobs are equal.

386
00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:34.692
So do I.

387
00:28:34.932 --> 00:28:35.932
Pardon?

388
00:28:36.531 --> 00:28:38.301
I'm busy, so...

389
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:39.872
- But... - Okay.

390
00:28:39.872 --> 00:28:40.872
But...

391
00:28:44.402 --> 00:28:46.102
I heard lawyers have it tough lately,

392
00:28:46.412 --> 00:28:48.311
but must she really do that?

393
00:28:48.672 --> 00:28:49.981
What do you mean?

394
00:28:51.142 --> 00:28:53.751
Nothing. Let us live a good life, at least.

395
00:28:54.051 --> 00:28:55.082
Goodness.

396
00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:00.122
You saw, right?

397
00:29:00.551 --> 00:29:02.622
I had to get rid of that crazy woman.

398
00:29:03.521 --> 00:29:05.291
Sorry for saying you were my girlfriend.

399
00:29:05.991 --> 00:29:07.461
I don't mind.

400
00:29:08.531 --> 00:29:09.531
What?

401
00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:11.632
You don't need to apologize.

402
00:29:11.832 --> 00:29:13.801
I was happy being your girlfriend...

403
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:15.432
for those few minutes.

404
00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:17.541
What?

405
00:29:17.872 --> 00:29:19.142
What do you mean?

406
00:29:19.811 --> 00:29:21.011
You didn't know?

407
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:24.582
I liked you from the first time I saw you.

408
00:29:27.551 --> 00:29:28.551
Me too.

409
00:29:32.582 --> 00:29:34.822
How is the appeal preparation going?

410
00:29:35.692 --> 00:29:37.892
We have plenty to rebut the assertions...

411
00:29:37.892 --> 00:29:39.692
the prosecution has made.

412
00:29:39.692 --> 00:29:41.692
This has to be the last time.

413
00:29:41.991 --> 00:29:43.862
Are you confident we'll win?

414
00:29:44.132 --> 00:29:46.501
Yes. You may rest assured.

415
00:29:49.672 --> 00:29:50.842
Tell me,

416
00:29:51.201 --> 00:29:53.471
how long have you worked for Gap Soo?

417
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:55.412
I was scouted...

418
00:29:55.412 --> 00:29:57.642
by Hyungjae when I left the prosecutors' office,

419
00:29:57.981 --> 00:29:59.342
so I'm going on five years.

420
00:29:59.682 --> 00:30:01.311
Five years?

421
00:30:03.582 --> 00:30:06.352
Then you've done a lot.

422
00:30:07.092 --> 00:30:10.322
Are you interested in working for me now?

423
00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:16.201
At 10am at Yeongpa Cultural Center,

424
00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:19.402
you have a lecture on "Making a Happy Yeongpa".

425
00:30:19.632 --> 00:30:20.701
At 2pm,

426
00:30:20.832 --> 00:30:23.842
you have the Regional Business Conference.

427
00:30:24.001 --> 00:30:25.442
At 5pm,

428
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:27.372
after visiting Yeongpa Market,

429
00:30:27.372 --> 00:30:29.011
you will be leading a meeting...

430
00:30:29.011 --> 00:30:30.912
on how to revive the business district.

431
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:42.322
- Yes? - It's about Baek Min Ho.

432
00:30:42.692 --> 00:30:45.791
I think he's going to tell that prosecutor something.

433
00:30:48.632 --> 00:30:50.132
Take care of it.

434
00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:51.832
Yes, sir.

435
00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:09.451
Hey.

436
00:31:19.122 --> 00:31:20.432
Found it.

437
00:31:24.061 --> 00:31:25.231
What...

438
00:31:25.602 --> 00:31:26.701
Bring him.

439
00:31:27.402 --> 00:31:29.672
No!

440
00:31:30.402 --> 00:31:31.971
That isn't mine!

441
00:31:42.011 --> 00:31:43.481
That isn't mine!

442
00:31:43.951 --> 00:31:45.751
That isn't mine!

443
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:47.352
Come on.

444
00:31:48.322 --> 00:31:49.622
Come on.

445
00:31:50.422 --> 00:31:52.761
I know you can do it.

446
00:31:53.092 --> 00:31:54.961
Get my Yun Hee out.

447
00:31:55.932 --> 00:31:58.761
When did she become "your" Yun Hee?

448
00:31:59.061 --> 00:32:02.001
Since yesterday. She and I love each other.

449
00:32:02.301 --> 00:32:05.142
So she wants to quit going to the Kingdom.

450
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:06.271
Really?

451
00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:08.112
- She says she loves you? - Yes.

452
00:32:08.241 --> 00:32:09.612
She wants to quit the Kingdom?

453
00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:11.811
- Drop the garbage. - Hey.

454
00:32:12.442 --> 00:32:14.182
Do I look like I'm kidding?

455
00:32:14.211 --> 00:32:15.551
No.

456
00:32:15.582 --> 00:32:17.822
The future Prime Minister really likes her.

457
00:32:17.822 --> 00:32:20.791
Replace her with someone who looks like her.

458
00:32:20.892 --> 00:32:24.322
What if things work out and we get married?

459
00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:26.332
Then things could get awkward.

460
00:32:31.362 --> 00:32:32.402
Will you do it?

461
00:32:33.172 --> 00:32:34.432
Get it together...

462
00:32:34.432 --> 00:32:36.102
unless you want to get in trouble with him.

463
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:41.471
- Hello, sir. - Did you see...

464
00:32:41.471 --> 00:32:43.741
my hole-in-one golf ball in the Kingdom?

465
00:32:45.241 --> 00:32:46.412
Where is it?

466
00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:48.781
Where am I supposed to find it?

467
00:32:49.751 --> 00:32:51.922
Darn it. Seriously.

468
00:32:52.582 --> 00:32:55.322
Can't he do this himself?

469
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:18.882
Darn it. He took it with him.

470
00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:37.138
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E13 Witch's Court "The Kingdom"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

471
00:33:48.112 --> 00:33:50.342
(Babe. When do you want to come over?)

472
00:33:52.882 --> 00:33:54.811
No. It's too dangerous.

473
00:33:55.612 --> 00:33:57.582
I don't know how long I'll have to wait...

474
00:33:57.582 --> 00:33:58.951
if I miss this chance.

475
00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:00.692
Should I go with her?

476
00:34:00.922 --> 00:34:03.692
Someone who has been to crime scenes should...

477
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:05.422
That's worse.

478
00:34:06.362 --> 00:34:09.431
You want to trespass and steal as a team?

479
00:34:09.632 --> 00:34:13.072
It isn't trespassing. He invited her over.

480
00:34:13.572 --> 00:34:15.831
We know where the video is.

481
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:17.742
We can't sit back and do nothing.

482
00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:20.271
What if he catches you leaving with the video?

483
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:22.112
Can you guarantee nothing will go wrong?

484
00:34:23.612 --> 00:34:25.342
Let's look for another way.

485
00:34:27.552 --> 00:34:30.052
That's right. I thought about it,

486
00:34:30.052 --> 00:34:31.621
and we shouldn't break the law.

487
00:34:32.422 --> 00:34:33.952
Do as she says.

488
00:34:47.202 --> 00:34:48.972
There are plenty of ways...

489
00:34:48.972 --> 00:34:50.742
to legally use the government's power.

490
00:34:51.742 --> 00:34:52.871
Like what?

491
00:34:52.871 --> 00:34:55.112
Ways that I know well from experience.

492
00:34:57.882 --> 00:34:59.081
Give me your number.

493
00:34:59.081 --> 00:35:01.282
Text we when you schedule the date to go over.

494
00:35:04.351 --> 00:35:05.922
As I'm sure you could tell,

495
00:35:05.922 --> 00:35:08.291
I work differently from Ms. Min.

496
00:35:09.422 --> 00:35:10.961
I like that.

497
00:35:19.972 --> 00:35:21.532
So? Did you look into it?

498
00:35:21.871 --> 00:35:23.271
Yes. Jin Yun Hee.

499
00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:24.871
Her sister was Jin Sul Hee,

500
00:35:24.871 --> 00:35:26.041
who killed herself in 2004.

501
00:35:26.311 --> 00:35:27.371
Okay.

502
00:35:28.012 --> 00:35:29.481
Send me the documents and photos.

503
00:35:40.922 --> 00:35:43.092
(Family Registry: Jin Yun Hee)

504
00:35:43.092 --> 00:35:46.061
(Sibling: Jin Sul Hee, deceased)

505
00:35:46.961 --> 00:35:49.161
A rat sneaked in.

506
00:35:50.061 --> 00:35:52.061
I'm sorry, sir. I'll take care of it.

507
00:35:54.632 --> 00:35:55.831
No.

508
00:35:57.402 --> 00:35:59.512
Even if she has guts of steel,

509
00:36:00.842 --> 00:36:04.742
she wouldn't have come if she were working alone.

510
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:09.751
I'm sure there's someone behind her.

511
00:36:12.621 --> 00:36:16.521
Find out who that is first.

512
00:36:18.262 --> 00:36:19.362
Yes, sir.

513
00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:27.271
- What? - How did it go?

514
00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:28.831
Did you find a replacement?

515
00:36:29.172 --> 00:36:30.572
Darn it. Seriously.

516
00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:32.972
You ignored everything I said, didn't you?

517
00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:36.282
Get my Yun Hee out quickly.

518
00:36:36.512 --> 00:36:38.911
What's your problem?

519
00:36:39.751 --> 00:36:42.612
Stop overreacting, you punk. She...

520
00:36:44.751 --> 00:36:46.922
Anyway, she doesn't really like you.

521
00:36:46.952 --> 00:36:49.561
How do you know that? Did you meet her?

522
00:36:49.822 --> 00:36:52.762
She's so apologetic to me about what she has to do!

523
00:36:53.532 --> 00:36:56.362
I really want things to work out with her.

524
00:36:56.501 --> 00:36:58.902
Hey! You're my friend, aren't you?

525
00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:01.072
Can't you do this much for me?

526
00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:05.242
You frustrating moron.

527
00:37:09.072 --> 00:37:10.282
Did he hang up on me?

528
00:37:11.782 --> 00:37:13.952
I'm losing my mind. Darn it.

529
00:37:29.702 --> 00:37:31.161
I hear you're seeing Dong Shik.

530
00:37:33.172 --> 00:37:34.302
I am.

531
00:37:34.702 --> 00:37:37.072
He's going crazy about how much he loves you.

532
00:37:38.902 --> 00:37:40.112
What about you?

533
00:37:43.382 --> 00:37:44.581
Well...

534
00:37:45.512 --> 00:37:46.882
Stop coming here.

535
00:37:47.711 --> 00:37:48.711
What?

536
00:37:48.711 --> 00:37:51.952
You can stop servicing the elders.

537
00:37:53.351 --> 00:37:54.592
Why?

538
00:37:54.992 --> 00:37:56.961
Did I do something wrong?

539
00:37:57.692 --> 00:37:58.891
That's not it.

540
00:38:03.661 --> 00:38:05.161
Seriously.

541
00:38:05.561 --> 00:38:07.431
Dong Shik, that punk,

542
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:10.271
keeps begging me to get you out.

543
00:38:11.302 --> 00:38:14.072
You must feel weird doing this while seeing him too.

544
00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:21.411
Ignore what Dong Shik says.

545
00:38:22.751 --> 00:38:24.282
It's okay.

546
00:38:25.581 --> 00:38:28.992
To be honest, we're not that far along yet.

547
00:38:31.092 --> 00:38:32.262
I want...

548
00:38:33.362 --> 00:38:35.461
to continue working at the Kingdom.

549
00:38:36.561 --> 00:38:38.702
It suits my personality.

550
00:38:39.831 --> 00:38:41.132
I like it.

551
00:38:42.972 --> 00:38:44.072
Do you mean it?

552
00:38:44.842 --> 00:38:48.172
Yes. I have no intention of quitting.

553
00:38:52.411 --> 00:38:54.612
Fine. Okay.

554
00:38:54.981 --> 00:38:56.282
You may go.

555
00:38:56.552 --> 00:38:57.652
Okay.

556
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:12.362
Did you hear that?

557
00:39:12.972 --> 00:39:15.101
Love? As if.

558
00:39:15.601 --> 00:39:18.641
She's using you. Wake up, punk.

559
00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:33.751
Baek Min Ho, come out.

560
00:39:47.871 --> 00:39:51.342
Don't tell me you think there's hope, do you?

561
00:39:54.742 --> 00:39:56.911
Don't say anything stupid,

562
00:39:57.012 --> 00:39:59.012
and just stay quiet...

563
00:39:59.581 --> 00:40:01.681
if you want to stay alive.

564
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:04.652
Okay?

565
00:40:06.692 --> 00:40:07.822
Go.

566
00:40:15.831 --> 00:40:17.362
I'll tell you everything.

567
00:40:20.302 --> 00:40:22.771
If I'll die whether or not I talk,

568
00:40:23.302 --> 00:40:24.501
I should talk.

569
00:40:25.242 --> 00:40:27.371
I won't be the only one suffering any longer.

570
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:31.342
The location where Kong Soo Ah was attacked.

571
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:34.612
It was not in an ordinary hotel room.

572
00:40:36.322 --> 00:40:37.681
It was in the Kingdom.

573
00:40:38.952 --> 00:40:42.121
It's in Hyungjae Hotel, on the K floor.

574
00:40:46.192 --> 00:40:47.192
Kingdom?

575
00:40:47.192 --> 00:40:49.902
A secret lobbying place that Cho Gap Soo created.

576
00:40:50.561 --> 00:40:52.632
That was where the video of Kong Soo Ah...

577
00:40:53.931 --> 00:40:55.331
was filmed too.

578
00:41:03.012 --> 00:41:05.612
You're sure Choi Yong Woon isn't coming home today?

579
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:10.222
(Yong Woon is going away for work. Come over.)

580
00:41:10.981 --> 00:41:12.181
Okay.

581
00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:16.762
- What is all of this? - I told you.

582
00:41:16.762 --> 00:41:19.592
It's a way to legally use the government's power.

583
00:41:21.192 --> 00:41:22.192
Awesome.

584
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:25.302
First,

585
00:41:25.302 --> 00:41:26.672
leave them in the bathroom.

586
00:41:26.672 --> 00:41:29.202
And make sure to put one in Choi Yong Woon's room.

587
00:41:30.172 --> 00:41:31.242
Okay.

588
00:41:31.802 --> 00:41:33.311
I'll call it in after 10 minutes.

589
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:36.612
Once they're in place, get out of there.

590
00:41:37.081 --> 00:41:38.981
I'll say he secretly videoed women...

591
00:41:38.981 --> 00:41:40.581
and have the cops search his place.

592
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:42.181
Okay.

593
00:42:00.302 --> 00:42:02.702
- I'm here. - Hey. Come in.

594
00:42:02.702 --> 00:42:04.101
Thank you.

595
00:42:04.572 --> 00:42:06.242
May I use the bathroom?

596
00:42:06.242 --> 00:42:08.442
- Sure. That way. - Thanks.

597
00:42:58.961 --> 00:42:59.961
Ms. Min.

598
00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:02.032
I'll find the video.

599
00:43:02.592 --> 00:43:04.231
I'm with Yi Deum.

600
00:43:13.012 --> 00:43:14.242
- Dong Shik. - Yes?

601
00:43:14.641 --> 00:43:17.141
I'm hungry. Will you make me instant noodles?

602
00:43:17.141 --> 00:43:18.711
Were you hungry?

603
00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:20.711
I'll cook it right away.

604
00:43:20.782 --> 00:43:21.782
Thanks.

605
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:38.802
What are you doing?

606
00:43:41.032 --> 00:43:42.032
What?

607
00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:44.242
Bathroom.

608
00:43:45.942 --> 00:43:47.012
But...

609
00:43:48.842 --> 00:43:50.681
you just went to the bathroom.

610
00:43:54.152 --> 00:43:55.882
I looked into Jin Yun Hee.

611
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:58.952
It looks like Min Ji Sook...

612
00:43:59.382 --> 00:44:01.692
and Ma Yi Deum are working with her.

613
00:44:02.092 --> 00:44:03.561
Ma Yi Deum?

614
00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:29.112
(Ma Yi Deum, prosecutor)

615
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:36.862
Hey.

616
00:44:38.762 --> 00:44:40.362
Did you think I was an idiot?

617
00:44:41.532 --> 00:44:42.532
Dong Shik.

618
00:45:03.322 --> 00:45:04.481
Yi Deum!

619
00:45:17.661 --> 00:45:18.831
Shoot.

620
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:27.472
They walked in on their own,

621
00:45:28.271 --> 00:45:30.211
so cut off their feet.

622
00:45:32.442 --> 00:45:35.181
Put a weapon on them after you kill them.

623
00:45:35.481 --> 00:45:37.552
Then you can say it was self defense.

624
00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:39.851
No one can complain.

625
00:45:49.331 --> 00:45:51.862
Ms. Min. I'll find the video.

626
00:45:51.862 --> 00:45:53.431
I'm with Yi Deum.

627
00:45:58.871 --> 00:46:00.771
The phone has been turned off.

628
00:46:02.811 --> 00:46:03.811
Ms. Min.

629
00:46:04.342 --> 00:46:05.711
Hyungjae Hotel has a secret...

630
00:46:05.711 --> 00:46:08.081
Wait. Just a second.

631
00:46:09.081 --> 00:46:11.322
I think something happened to Ma.

632
00:46:19.931 --> 00:46:21.231
I'll go.

633
00:46:57.001 --> 00:46:59.831
The phone has been turned off. Please...

634
00:47:25.121 --> 00:47:27.391
Did you approach me intentionally that night?

635
00:47:29.601 --> 00:47:31.202
They're psychotic.

636
00:47:31.302 --> 00:47:32.302
Step aside.

637
00:47:34.831 --> 00:47:35.831
Hey.

638
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:39.371
Why did you come here?

639
00:47:40.641 --> 00:47:42.541
What were you looking for?

640
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:44.041
You have the video, right?

641
00:47:44.041 --> 00:47:45.112
Hand it over.

642
00:47:45.681 --> 00:47:46.711
Video?

643
00:47:46.711 --> 00:47:49.012
The one you threatened Cho Gap Soo with.

644
00:47:49.012 --> 00:47:50.751
Hand it over.

645
00:47:53.052 --> 00:47:54.521
It'll be better for you...

646
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:56.422
to hand it over while I'm being nice.

647
00:48:00.192 --> 00:48:01.992
How are you so confident?

648
00:48:02.632 --> 00:48:04.501
You should worry about yourself.

649
00:48:05.202 --> 00:48:06.331
Do you think...

650
00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:09.072
you guys will walk out of here alive?

651
00:48:09.072 --> 00:48:11.472
What? Did you think we'd tremble in fear?

652
00:48:11.672 --> 00:48:14.311
Hey. I was a prosecutor for seven years.

653
00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:16.942
I've seen countless punks like you.

654
00:48:16.942 --> 00:48:18.282
You don't scare me.

655
00:48:20.012 --> 00:48:22.181
You should cooperate before the cops come.

656
00:48:22.251 --> 00:48:24.222
I called them before I came here.

657
00:48:24.222 --> 00:48:25.382
You did?

658
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:27.822
What a little...

659
00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.992
You'll rot in jail if you keep refusing.

660
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:35.492
See? See? Police! Help!

661
00:48:35.731 --> 00:48:38.001
Over here! Here!

662
00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:42.132
- Help! - The police are here.

663
00:48:42.132 --> 00:48:43.871
Make them go away.

664
00:48:56.012 --> 00:48:57.121
Is anyone home?

665
00:49:10.961 --> 00:49:12.402
Excuse us.

666
00:49:12.561 --> 00:49:13.931
We received a call.

667
00:49:14.202 --> 00:49:17.601
Does either of your number end in 7451?

668
00:49:18.842 --> 00:49:21.672
I called it in, actually.

669
00:49:22.411 --> 00:49:23.581
I'm sorry.

670
00:49:24.342 --> 00:49:25.981
It was a prank call.

671
00:49:25.981 --> 00:49:26.981
What?

672
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:29.052
He and I were fooling around,

673
00:49:29.652 --> 00:49:31.751
and I called as a prank.

674
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:33.751
I didn't think you'd really come.

675
00:49:34.291 --> 00:49:35.492
I'm sorry.

676
00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:39.461
You should know better. You shouldn't do this.

677
00:49:39.791 --> 00:49:41.592
Because of pranks by people like you,

678
00:49:41.592 --> 00:49:43.161
those who really need help...

679
00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:46.001
lose their chance to get help. Do you understand?

680
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:47.001
Yes, sir.

681
00:49:47.472 --> 00:49:48.831
I'm sorry.

682
00:49:49.202 --> 00:49:50.902
Don't do this again.

683
00:49:51.172 --> 00:49:52.202
I'm sorry.

684
00:49:55.711 --> 00:49:56.711
Wait.

685
00:51:12.121 --> 00:51:14.722
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

686
00:51:14.722 --> 00:51:16.362
It'll never happen again.

687
00:51:16.561 --> 00:51:17.862
Have a good night.

688
00:51:18.362 --> 00:51:20.061
- Please be careful. - Yes, sir.

689
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:24.961
Get inside.

690
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:30.472
Just a minute.

691
00:51:33.172 --> 00:51:35.041
- I'm a prosecutor. - Yes, sir.

692
00:51:35.311 --> 00:51:37.242
- We must search there. - Pardon?

693
00:51:37.242 --> 00:51:39.751
An abducted woman is in there. Please hurry.

694
00:51:40.282 --> 00:51:42.282
- Abducted? - Yes, sir.

695
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:48.092
Come in.

696
00:52:02.032 --> 00:52:03.402
Let go!

697
00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:04.842
Let go!

698
00:52:05.442 --> 00:52:06.641
Let go!

699
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:11.782
Let go!

700
00:52:11.842 --> 00:52:13.012
- Darn it. - Yi Deum.

701
00:52:13.012 --> 00:52:14.711
- Let go! - Yi Deum!

702
00:52:20.251 --> 00:52:22.922
Let go of me. Let go.

703
00:52:25.192 --> 00:52:26.492
- Ms. Ma. - Choi Yong Woon.

704
00:52:26.492 --> 00:52:28.891
Get Choi Yong Woon first. He has the video.

705
00:52:29.032 --> 00:52:30.161
Hurry.

706
00:53:05.362 --> 00:53:06.431
Darn it.

707
00:53:56.552 --> 00:53:59.021
Sorry. I didn't think it through.

708
00:54:00.021 --> 00:54:01.751
Shoot. Seriously.

709
00:54:06.021 --> 00:54:07.061
Hold on.

710
00:54:09.702 --> 00:54:11.661
What about the video? Is it in there?

711
00:54:16.101 --> 00:54:17.242
Ms. Ma.

712
00:54:22.271 --> 00:54:23.942
Why are you so reckless?

713
00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:26.581
What if something worse had happened?

714
00:54:27.081 --> 00:54:28.911
You should've told me at least!

715
00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:32.351
Why are you getting so angry?

716
00:54:32.751 --> 00:54:34.052
I'm sorry.

717
00:54:34.192 --> 00:54:36.092
I was wrong. I mean it.

718
00:54:36.521 --> 00:54:38.661
That's why I came like this.

719
00:54:41.132 --> 00:54:44.632
Worry about yourself. Look. You're hurt.

720
00:54:45.862 --> 00:54:47.032
It hurts, right?

721
00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:51.972
Are you okay?

722
00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:53.871
It hurts.

723
00:54:54.641 --> 00:54:56.012
Seriously.

724
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:01.251
(Attorney at Law, Min Ji Sook)

725
00:55:37.952 --> 00:55:40.121
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

726
00:55:42.621 --> 00:55:44.161
The defendant insisted...

727
00:55:44.661 --> 00:55:47.391
that Baek Min Ho murdered Kong Soo Ah,

728
00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:49.092
and submitted a glove...

729
00:55:49.092 --> 00:55:50.702
with Baek Min Ho's blood as evidence.

730
00:55:51.402 --> 00:55:54.072
Jung Young Ho of NFS, who analyzed the blood,

731
00:55:54.472 --> 00:55:55.672
submitted this written statement.

732
00:56:00.911 --> 00:56:04.481
He states that no such evidence existed,

733
00:56:04.911 --> 00:56:07.882
and that he forged it per Ahn Tae Kyoo's request.

734
00:56:10.251 --> 00:56:13.092
It proves he concealed his own crime...

735
00:56:13.751 --> 00:56:17.661
and that he was the real murderer.

736
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:20.461
Defense. Do you have anything to say?

737
00:56:21.692 --> 00:56:23.032
I'd like to submit...

738
00:56:23.101 --> 00:56:26.061
Lee Sang Joon's letter of resignation from NFS.

739
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:37.541
Why are you submitting this?

740
00:56:37.782 --> 00:56:41.851
He was the NFS technician who analyzed the glove...

741
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:43.922
the prosecution submitted into evidence.

742
00:56:44.382 --> 00:56:47.152
He was fired for embezzlement.

743
00:56:48.922 --> 00:56:52.161
If we accept the assertion that the glove evidence...

744
00:56:52.161 --> 00:56:54.331
was forged as per Ahn Tae Kyoo's orders,

745
00:56:55.791 --> 00:56:57.402
we must also question...

746
00:56:57.561 --> 00:57:00.802
the glove the prosecution submitted.

747
00:57:03.641 --> 00:57:05.271
(Letter of Resignation)

748
00:57:08.972 --> 00:57:11.612
Both pieces of evidence the parties submitted...

749
00:57:12.181 --> 00:57:14.382
lack credibility, and thus,

750
00:57:15.112 --> 00:57:18.052
we will exclude both from consideration.

751
00:57:18.981 --> 00:57:20.121
Prosecution.

752
00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:22.652
Do you have any other evidence?

753
00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:27.431
The trial is over.

754
00:57:28.192 --> 00:57:29.231
Let's go.

755
00:57:56.592 --> 00:57:57.692
Your Honor.

756
00:57:58.322 --> 00:58:00.492
I'm the defendant Baek Min Ho's new counsel.

757
00:58:01.461 --> 00:58:02.731
Ma Yi Deum.

758
00:58:28.552 --> 00:58:31.192
(Witch's Court)

759
00:58:31.322 --> 00:58:34.092
I submit a video of Ahn Tae Kyoo assaulting...

760
00:58:34.092 --> 00:58:35.431
the victim into evidence.

761
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:38.001
We need to silence the prosecutor first.

762
00:58:38.001 --> 00:58:39.362
He caught us off guard.

763
00:58:39.362 --> 00:58:40.601
Three months of suspension?

764
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:42.902
We decided to go to Bujin.

765
00:58:43.371 --> 00:58:44.771
Is this for me, Mom?

766
00:58:44.871 --> 00:58:47.442
Something necessitating a special investigation.

767
00:58:47.442 --> 00:58:49.442
We need Baek Sang Ho's journal then.

768
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:51.641
This calls for a fatal blow.

769
00:58:51.882 --> 00:58:54.211
Evidence regarding Baek Sang Ho's suicide?

770
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:55.552
Team up with us.

771
00:58:57.521 --> 00:58:59.952
Let's catch Cho Gap Soo.
