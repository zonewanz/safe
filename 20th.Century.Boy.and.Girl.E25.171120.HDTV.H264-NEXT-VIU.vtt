1
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:10.770
I'm seeing someone.

2
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.170
- What? - I have a boyfriend.

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.440
You're dating?

4
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:19.941
Who is this scum?

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.781
Scum?

6
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.421
Who is this person that has the honor of dating you?

7
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.520
Gong Ji Won.

8
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.250
What?

9
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:32.220
It's Gong Ji Won.

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.360
- Gong Ji Won. - President Gong?

11
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.491
The Gong Ji Won that I know of? The member of the Four Bongos?

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.531
Yes.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.771
How about "We Got Married"?

14
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.800
We need to deal with that first.

15
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.741
Don't you know what happens to those who get involved in scandals?

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.381
And he's Anthony's brother.

17
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:58.281
Like it or not, you're Anthony's wife to the public.

18
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.951
Gosh. This is a nicer version of the story.

19
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.290
Are you trying to ruin your life?

20
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.530
That's why I told you to sort it out for me.

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.661
I told you...

22
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760
to tell me everything if anything happens. Everything.

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.601
Where do I start?

24
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:20.801
I'll do it.

25
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.170
I've talked to Anthony.

26
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.510
- What? - Just follow me.

27
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.361
She's so serious about this.

28
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.730
She'd be sad to stop shooting this program.

29
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.961
Doesn't she like Anthony?

30
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.170
She loves him.

31
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.930
But she says it's different.

32
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.711
- You know what she says. - "He needs to date a better girl."

33
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:57.071
"Why would he like me?"

34
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.040
Are you talking about these?

35
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.780
Yes.

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.551
I'm really sorry.

37
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:05.980
Weren't we going to continue until season 10?

38
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.390
I know it's going to cause problems for the staff,

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.591
but I thought it'd be better to tell you in advance.

40
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:16.290
Yes, thank you.

41
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.501
Now that you've told me the truth, I can at least try to find a way.

42
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.471
There has been so many scandals,

43
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.601
but many of them could have been prevented if only they had told us.

44
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:30.010
In many cases, the problem got worse because they didn't tell us.

45
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:33.040
So the program has a bad image.

46
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.751
It's on top of the list of programs that people want abolished.

47
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.221
Still, I'm sorry.

48
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.950
But I was moved.

49
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.990
Most people ask their managers to take care of things like this.

50
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.821
You and Anthony...

51
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.390
came to me in person.

52
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.931
Let's part ways amicably.

53
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.300
- Anthony was here? - Just now.

54
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.740
He sat right there.

55
00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:01.971
He said he talked to you...

56
00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:03.871
and that he's quitting for health reasons.

57
00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:05.740
Now, I see it was an excuse.

58
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.450
After he left, I thought about what to do.

59
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.851
We'll turn your honeymoon...

60
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.950
into a farewell trip.

61
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.321
To do that, we'll need to tape another interview.

62
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:22.561
Thank you. I'll make it up to you.

63
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:25.901
Call me whenever you need me.

64
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.760
Just not for "We Got Married".

65
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.931
Thank you.

66
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.300
Your last episode won't air for a few weeks.

67
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.001
Beware of reporters.

68
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.640
They always sniff something out.

69
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.210
There might already be one on your tail.

70
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.781
Okay.

71
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.890
- My goodness. - I beg of you.

72
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:55.890
Please...

73
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.161
do not upload the article.

74
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.800
I have nothing to my name,

75
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.631
so this is all I can do.

76
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.670
And you still want to do "We Got Married"?

77
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.971
No.

78
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:10.841
- It's not that. - Then what?

79
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:12.740
Why are you going out on a limb?

80
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.351
People will at least pity you if this goes out.

81
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.551
Oh, are you worried about your fake wife?

82
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:24.191
Or the brother you aren't related to? Or both?

83
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.260
Gosh, you're such a saint.

84
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.530
Anthony.

85
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.631
Our industry is a mess,

86
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.700
but it's not child's play.

87
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:39.071
If you have the energy to plead on your knees,

88
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.301
think up...

89
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:42.510
something romantic to say on social media...

90
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.140
when the news breaks tomorrow, okay?

91
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:02.931
Ho Sung.

92
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.431
Why didn't you call last month?

93
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:12.100
Do you know how worried I was?

94
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:17.470
It's getting cold. Are your bronchial tubes acting up?

95
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.840
My poor daughter.

96
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.850
Drink balloon flower root tea often,

97
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.720
and don't eat or drink anything that's cold.

98
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:48.010
What are you doing? Come inside.

99
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.010
Why won't you come inside?

100
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.551
Come to my place.

101
00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:04.191
Did you wait for me to make me hot chocolate?

102
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.821
You love it on a cold day.

103
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.631
By the way,

104
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.530
why did you look at me like that earlier?

105
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:15.631
How?

106
00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:17.731
You looked like you had something to say.

107
00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:21.200
- You were mistaken. - Was I?

108
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.441
The dracaena fragrans you gave me died.

109
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.090
Isn't that a bad omen?

110
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.731
It bothered me the whole day.

111
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:55.241
- What's going on? - My neck hurts.

112
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:56.611
Is something up?

113
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.510
Yes.

114
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.580
I'm teasing you.

115
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:07.150
Here.

116
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.121
Nothing's wrong, so stop asking.

117
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.330
Something's up with me.

118
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.731
I decided to quit "We Got Married".

119
00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:26.470
I talked to Anthony and told the team today.

120
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.981
You just have to say I did the right thing.

121
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.090
Well done.

122
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:48.491
Drink up. It'll make you feel better.

123
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.660
Okay.

124
00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:56.400
Ji Won.

125
00:07:57.171 --> 00:07:59.470
I'll tell my family.

126
00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:06.481
It's good.

127
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.450
- Is it good? - Yes.

128
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:23.760
(The 13th story: While You Are in Love)

129
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.871
(Episode 25)

130
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.771
I bought this.

131
00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:36.541
What's that? Glasses?

132
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:38.311
Reading glasses.

133
00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:40.941
Mom's has farsightedness.

134
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.051
She must be getting old.

135
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.021
She's aging.

136
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.360
Everyone ages. We're growing old too.

137
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:55.931
When do you think your mom's getting old?

138
00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:01.130
When she keeps saying she wishes I were 18.

139
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.870
What about you?

140
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.641
When she hates taking photos.

141
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:11.271
She says her age shows in photos.

142
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.110
I have a favorite photo of her.

143
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.651
I think we were about 4 or 5.

144
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.051
It's a photo of me,

145
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:25.321
Ho Sung, and Mom taken outside grandmother's house.

146
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:29.330
There's a flared, one-piece dress that Mom always wore to go out.

147
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.730
She always wore a cosmos brooch whenever she wore that dress.

148
00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:36.200
There was a ruby at the center.

149
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.100
That's what she's wearing in that photo.

150
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.171
I remember bits and pieces from that day.

151
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:47.710
Either the weather was great or I felt great,

152
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.521
but the brooch sparkled even more than usual,

153
00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:55.421
and Mom looked so pretty and sweet.

154
00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:58.421
She was young.

155
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.561
In that photo,

156
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.531
Mom would've been 10 years younger than I am now.

157
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:18.041
Stop staring into the distance, and eat.

158
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:19.811
You aren't even well.

159
00:10:19.811 --> 00:10:21.710
She's so cruel.

160
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:25.980
I wish she'd just let me hear her voice.

161
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:29.850
She was a mom's girl,

162
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.021
so why is she hurting me so much?

163
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:35.261
It's been over 10 years already.

164
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:36.791
Stop it already.

165
00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:40.561
How can I stop when she's my daughter?

166
00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:43.700
My heart breaks a little...

167
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.401
whenever I put rice in the cooker.

168
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.340
I wonder if she's eating well...

169
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.911
or if she ever has to tiptoe around others.

170
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.750
Oh dear.

171
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.321
I just wish I could see her eat a hot meal in front of me.

172
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.651
So eat, will you?

173
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:05.921
Eat so you have the energy to wait for her.

174
00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:16.771
Okay, I'll come to your place.

175
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.141
Bye.

176
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.441
- Anthony? - Yes.

177
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.181
I think I have to go and see him.

178
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.480
- Can I go? - Of course.

179
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:30.281
Eat something nice with him.

180
00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:32.620
He'd feel lonely eating all alone.

181
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.720
Don't you feel lonely without me?

182
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.061
I do.

183
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:41.061
But I'll let Anthony borrow you today.

184
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:44.330
He's changed.

185
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.401
- Ji Won's changed his mind. - Why?

186
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:50.801
He's always talking about his brother.

187
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:52.370
It's your honeymoon phase.

188
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.370
He should be carrying you around.

189
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.970
What about you? Does he carry you around?

190
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.641
Of course.

191
00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:06.321
- It's so uncomfortable. - What's uncomfortable?

192
00:12:06.321 --> 00:12:09.490
It's just too much. It's so uncomfortable.

193
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.990
Are you not a match?

194
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.830
Isn't Woo Sung so handsome though?

195
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.630
The Jung Woo Sung we all know?

196
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.901
Yes. He looks like Son Seok Hee.

197
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.370
He's so intellectual and cute too.

198
00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:29.840
He has teeth like a rabbit's. He goes like this.

199
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.641
Gosh, you're under his spell.

200
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.151
Why do you feel uncomfortable? What's the problem?

201
00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:39.551
I don't know. I feel fine before we meet.

202
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.720
I take two hours to shower,

203
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.691
exfoliate, give myself a facial,

204
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:45.620
and change 10 times.

205
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.990
And I wear a really nice perfume.

206
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.661
Could it be because you like him? Because you want him to like you?

207
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:52.860
Is that it?

208
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.171
But for some strange reason, when we meet, I feel uncomfortable.

209
00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:58.500
It's so awkward between us.

210
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.301
Introduce him to us. Let us size him up.

211
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.911
Bring him with you.

212
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:05.311
Will you know when you see him?

213
00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:07.441
Of course. Third parties can be more objective.

214
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.151
Okay. If that's the case, you should call someone too.

215
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:14.791
Ask Ji Won to come.

216
00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:16.620
I told you. He's meeting his brother.

217
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.691
Oh, right. Young Shim, you need to bring someone.

218
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:23.031
Bring whom? I've been single for 35 years without any flings.

219
00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:24.730
- Then call your dad at least. - Hey, you!

220
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200
That guy.

221
00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:29.970
"Don't be late!"

222
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.671
No, no. You're doing it wrong. "Don't be late!"

223
00:13:33.671 --> 00:13:35.210
- This is it. - Call that guy.

224
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.970
No way. He yelled at me today.

225
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.610
A crisis hides an opportunity!

226
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.950
I'm at Jin Jin's fried chicken restaurant. Want to swing by here?

227
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:49.821
Where are you?

228
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.141
(Recent call history: Ah Reum, Kang Kyung Seok, Jin Jin...)

229
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:11.641
(Kang Kyung Seok)

230
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:17.250
My goodness. Hey!

231
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.620
(Kang Kyung Seok)

232
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.220
Hey, have you gone mad? Don't call him. Hey!

233
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.950
- Ah Reum, don't. Please don't. - This is Kang Kyung Seok speaking.

234
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.291
Are you serious? Mr. Kang.

235
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.061
Hello, Mr. Kang.

236
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:35.571
Are you sure?

237
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.441
We should call President Jang. He needs to come up with a plan.

238
00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:40.641
There's no need.

239
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.340
You're certain, right? But how did you get him to change his mind?

240
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:46.610
- With my heart. - Unbelievable.

241
00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:50.250
Do you have company?

242
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:51.750
Yes, it's Ji Won.

243
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.551
- Ji Won? - Don't you say a word to him.

244
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.230
Take them back on your way home.

245
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:08.470
Okay.

246
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.901
Please tell her that I really liked the soup.

247
00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:13.100
Sure.

248
00:15:17.311 --> 00:15:18.840
I thought about why I was sick.

249
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.811
I think it was because of the ox bone soup.

250
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.710
I got so excited that...

251
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.580
I must have rushed and inhaled the soup.

252
00:15:27.421 --> 00:15:28.891
It must've been really difficult for me.

253
00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:31.661
I don't think I can eat ox bone soup ever again.

254
00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:33.720
So I don't plan on eating it.

255
00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:35.431
I won't even look at it.

256
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.561
Don't you like ox bone soup?

257
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.071
Yes, I do.

258
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.200
Then you can have my serving as well.

259
00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:50.970
Wait, no. You'd eat a lot even if not for me.

260
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.681
You like ox bone soup just as much.

261
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.151
Oh, right. You said you needed to talk to me.

262
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.921
So do I.

263
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:03.291
Should I go 1st? Or do you want to go 1st?

264
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.391
- Let me go first. - Sure.

265
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.191
I'm...

266
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.130
seeing Jin Jin.

267
00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:20.041
She's my first love.

268
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:25.181
You have a long history.

269
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:30.750
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

270
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:36.921
Is it my turn now?

271
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.860
Yes.

272
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:45.561
I'll drop out of "We Got Married" as soon as possible.

273
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.960
I'm not doing it for you.

274
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:51.200
I wanted to quit because I'm not cut out for that show.

275
00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:53.000
You don't need to worry about that.

276
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.511
By the way, until we end the program,

277
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.380
you two should be careful.

278
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.151
I heard some chatter circulating among reporters.

279
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.920
And lastly,

280
00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:09.690
this is really important.

281
00:17:10.951 --> 00:17:12.090
Go ahead.

282
00:17:13.021 --> 00:17:14.461
Do you want jjajangmyeon?

283
00:17:17.731 --> 00:17:18.830
Yes.

284
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.670
I want a supersize.

285
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.071
Whom did you text? Did you text Ji Won?

286
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:32.781
Don't worry. He's not coming.

287
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.850
I hope at least one person would show up.

288
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.751
This is driving me crazy.

289
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.150
I can't believe this.

290
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:06.340
I know. Exactly.

291
00:18:07.311 --> 00:18:09.350
- I'm going to kill you. - Why?

292
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.751
You're going to pay for this.

293
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:12.751
You have no boundaries.

294
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:15.090
- I can't believe you. - "Mr. Kang."

295
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.420
What? What is it?

296
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.930
Hello, Mr. Kang.

297
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.360
Hi.

298
00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:28.801
I'm Kang Kyung Seok.

299
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.640
- Hi. - Hello.

300
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.201
May I come in?

301
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.291
Would you like some beer?

302
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.821
Lawyer Jang and I had too much to drink the other day.

303
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.961
I'll stick with soda.

304
00:18:55.061 --> 00:18:56.791
Why did you come here?

305
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.501
I enjoy the atmosphere, not the drinks.

306
00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:01.501
Young Shim is the same way.

307
00:19:01.571 --> 00:19:03.170
Do you have a girlfriend?

308
00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:05.400
No.

309
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.670
How about a wife?

310
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:09.440
- I'm not married. - Neither is Young Shim.

311
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.840
Then where do you live?

312
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.711
I live in Gujeon-dong. It's 20 minutes away on foot.

313
00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:16.811
It's 20 minutes away from Young Shim's house too.

314
00:19:16.811 --> 00:19:18.051
How tall are you?

315
00:19:18.051 --> 00:19:19.650
I'm a bit less than 180cm.

316
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.890
That's perfect. Their height difference is 15cm.

317
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.650
What are your hobbies? Do you play sports?

318
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.620
I neither play well nor like sports.

319
00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:30.031
- Young Shim isn't athletic either. - Hey.

320
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.801
All right. You'll exchange eye contact as the final step.

321
00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:38.071
Here you go. 1, 2, 3.

322
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.481
My apologies.

323
00:19:54.821 --> 00:19:56.150
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.420
Reum!

325
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.130
You... You came.

326
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.100
I'm sorry I came late.

327
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.600
Hey, Jin Jin. Young Shim.

328
00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:11.301
Hi, Ji Won. Wait.

329
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.041
I thought you were Ji Won.

330
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:15.571
Hello. Nice to meet you.

331
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.011
I see. Is he your boyfriend, Young Shim?

332
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.481

Bye.

337

Jin Jin. There's your other half.

Hey, Min Ho. Didn't you miss me?

343
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.610
Surprisingly, no.

344

- Is that so? - Are you here for Jin Jin?

345
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.680
- No. I'm here for her money. - What?

346
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.051
You said you'd pay me 100 dollars. You need to pay up front.

347
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:03.650

370

I don't think we are compatible.

372

Be honest with me. Don't you feel uneasy around me? Isn't it awkward?

373
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.811
Well, just a little.

You should be yourself, and I should be myself.

We should go back to being our normal selves.

380

Let's stop trying to adjust to each other's tastes.

381

Yes, I'm fine with that.

384
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:15.751
- Okay. Then let's go. - Shall we?

385
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:18.291

387
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:24.630
Lawyer Jang, do you know what my dream is?

388
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.630
I want to be rich.

389
00:23:30.501 --> 00:23:34.771
But I realized that you can't become something just because you want to.

390
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.140
You're right.

391

Really?

395
00:23:50.491 --> 00:23:54.420
That's unexpected. You suddenly seem very romantic.

396
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:58.231
But I gave up.

397
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.830
In my first year of college, my father passed away.

398
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.041
It was a medical accident.

399
00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:08.771
It was supposed to be a simple knee surgery.

400
00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:10.511
But he passed away.

401
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.011
My mom told me...

402
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.721
that we should just ignore what happened.

403
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.021
That's why I started studying law.

404
00:24:23.521 --> 00:24:27.321
I thought there could be others like me who give up.

405
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:30.130
I wanted to be of help to them.

406
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.130
My dad is a guard.

407
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.440
He started working recently.

408
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.541
My dad...

409
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.511
has been poor all his life.

410
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:46.511
He will still be poor in the future.

411
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.150
And...

412
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:51.781
just like what happened to you when you were 20,

413
00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:54.350
if something bad happens to him,

414
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.991
no lawyer will be there to stand up for him.

415
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.860
So...

416
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.801
I want you to work for a long time...

417
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.940
and not get sick of it.

418

The one that said, "Don't be late, Young Shim," came today.

He's really handsome.

But he's not a good drinker.

429

When he was a freshman, he got drunk after drinking a glass of beer...

430
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.051
and threw up on someone he liked.

431
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.680
He said he threw up from the second floor once.

432
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.291
It would have been like a vomit free fall.

433
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.090
He doesn't drink very well, but he really enjoys the mood.

- Isn't that funny? - It is.

He's probably jealous because only you guys are tall.

495
00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:31.350
Gosh.

496
00:31:32.451 --> 00:31:33.981
They're good for the eyes too.

497
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:37.890
Maybe I should've bought Dad's too.

498
00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:40.491
I only bought one for Mom.

499
00:31:42.991 --> 00:31:44.830
What is this?

500
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.100
They're reading glasses. You said you have farsightedness.

501
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.501
Why did you buy it? I don't need it.

502
00:31:52.501 --> 00:31:54.910
I bought it myself because I knew you'd say that.

503
00:31:55.711 --> 00:31:56.910
Let's go to the optician's.

504
00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.680
You should get examined and get proper glasses.

505
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.981
- That's better for you. - I'm fine.

506
00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:03.781
Don't mind me.

507
00:32:11.791 --> 00:32:14.261
The concept of the limited edition shows...

508
00:32:14.261 --> 00:32:15.690
a cosmos that blooms in the ice...

509
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.930
with the moisture that has passed on from the ancient times.

510
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:19.501
It was created to signify...

511
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:23.100
that we'll help reclaim and recover the skin during the winter.

512
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.840
This product will be sold as a limited edition this Christmas.

513
00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:30.271
Ji Won.

514
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.241
Do you know what the meaning of cosmos is?

515
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.080
Not just any meaning.

516
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:39.481
The one that my sister made.

517
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.360
It means "I love you."

518
00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:49.930
Sir.

519
00:32:51.701 --> 00:32:52.830
President Gong?

520
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.801
Please check if there are similar products from our competitors.

521
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.840
And please add questions about container preferences...

522
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.041
in the customer survey this month.

523
00:33:03.571 --> 00:33:04.640
Yes, sir.

524
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.180
(Cremo Skin Renewal Cream)

525
00:33:08.981 --> 00:33:10.251
Thank you.

526
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.650
It looks good, right?

527
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:16.890
It was drawn by a famous illustrator on social media.

528
00:33:16.951 --> 00:33:19.491
It took me a lot of effort to recruit that illustrator.

529
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.061
Have you met in person? What's that person's name?

530
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.860
I didn't. That person didn't even have an email.

531
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.590
Then how did you make contact?

532
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.360
I sent a message on social media.

533
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.271
There was no other way. I couldn't even find out a phone number.

534
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:35.571
I tried to look that person up, but no one knows that person's...

535
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:37.410
gender, age, or what that person used to do.

536
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:42.951
That's probably why it looks kind of mysterious.

537
00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:44.481
What about the nickname?

538
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:46.680
The nickname was "Love Cosmos".

539
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.690
I need you to find out about that person. Find out everything.

540
00:33:57.671 --> 00:33:59.771
(Episode 26 will air shortly.)
