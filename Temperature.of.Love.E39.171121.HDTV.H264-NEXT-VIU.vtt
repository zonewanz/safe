00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.510
When you loved me,

2
00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.850
you tried to keep me as I am.

3
00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.960
But...

4
00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:20.930
I think I was in love with the feeling of love.

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.230
I thought the moth drawn to a flame was love.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.939
I thought it was okay to die.

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.069
I liked that.

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.910
In order to keep On Jung Sun...

9
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:38.279
as On Jung Sun,

10
00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:40.980
I had to protect you,

11
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.050
watch you,

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.550
and wait for you.

13
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.830
Take this.

14
00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.529
And give me the ring that you gave me before.

15
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.100
You know what a ring means, right?

16
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:11.380
Aren't you going to wear it?

17
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.579
I am.

18
00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.049
It doesn't fit.

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.749
It does.

20
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.189
It doesn't. It's not going in.

21
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.290
This is the trend. This is how you wear a ring.

22
00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:29.829
You don't know anything.

23
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.469
I will wear this.

24
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.549
Welcome.

25
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.880
- Hello. - What do you want to see?

26
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.380
Wait a moment.

27
00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:59.189
Can you show me this ring the size of my thumb?

28
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.389
Your thumb?

29
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.730
Yes.

30
00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.410
Did you know that...

31
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.209
if a ring that fits the girl's thumb fits the boy's ring finger,

32
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.410
they are made for each other.

33
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.190
My love...

34
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.859
wasn't destiny. It was my choice.

35
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.839
It's service time.

36
00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.179
You should go downstairs.

37
00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.450
Aren't you going?

38
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.049
Do you want to rest here?

39
00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.220
No, I want to go.

40
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.320
Wake up.

41
00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.850
Wake up.

42
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.500
Chef On, wake up.

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.530
(Temperature of Love)

44
00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.630
(Episode 39)

45
00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.700
Hyun Soo, your mom is here.

46
00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.869
Mom.

47
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.070
Where have you been?

48
00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.480
I went to see Jung Sun.

49
00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.739
- I'll be in my room. - All right.

50
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.049
I thought you were busy. You must still have time for dates.

51
00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.119
It's really nice to see you.

52
00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.649
Why are you here?

53
00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.560
I bought some side dishes for you.

54
00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.190
I couldn't make them.

55
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.089
Store-bought side dishes are really delicious.

56
00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.359
I'm sorry that you couldn't eat healthy...

57
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.769
because I had to go to work all my life.

58
00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.769
Mom, you became weak after you got sick.

59
00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:53.970
I've changed a bit...

60
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.970
since I became sick.

61
00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.780
I won't bother you too much. I'll leave soon.

62
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:03.280
All right.

63
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.530
- Hello. - Where's Chef On?

64
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.500
I'm asking you this seriously.

65
00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:25.800
Do you really want to open a flower shop?

66
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.240
I'm not sure.

67
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.510
It's going to be difficult.

68
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.680
I need to wake up early and visit the flower market.

69
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.750
Then don't do it.

70
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.180
But I want to do it.

71
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.579
I can't end my life like this.

72
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.250
All right.

73
00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:44.360
You should take care of Good Soup's flowers for a while.

74
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.190
I'll see how good you are, and if the customers like them,

75
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.360
I'll invest in your shop.

76
00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.260
You're not giving me the money?

77
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.760
I don't like starting off with a debt.

78
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.700
I didn't even say I was going to. You need to submit a business plan.

79
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.839
You're being really strict.

80
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.440
Then I'll give you pocket money. Live off of that money.

81
00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:05.610
(Yeon Woo: I'm happy. You didn't exactly decline.)

82
00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:10.180
(Jung Sun's Mother)

83
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.050
Yes, Mother.

84
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.829
I think Jung Sun will open a flower shop for me.

85
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.760
He told me to make a business plan. I don't know what to do.

86
00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:27.969
You have to do market research on foot.

87
00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:29.969
On foot?

88
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.139
Where are you?

89
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.170
Okay.

90
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.079
I'm unfamiliar with this side of you.

91
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.479
How can you call her that so easily?

92
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.320
I can't say anything since it's your life.

93
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.789
All I can do is support you as I have done until now.

94
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.190
Thank you.

95
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.860
I'm holding it in since that would only break our relationship.

96
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.829
I know. That's why I'm thanking you.

97
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.789
This is the CEO of On Entertainment.

98
00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.789
He's not the one I was going to meet.

99
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.360
(Business Proposal)

100
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.070
There are 156 florists in Bukchon alone.

101
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.639
There are about 10 near Good Soup.

102
00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.209
Why are there so many?

103
00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:43.979
You have to survive among all of them.

104
00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.079
I'm good at that...

105
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.209
although I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job.

106
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.849
That's good enough. Now, it's time for legwork.

107
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.450
Check the florists around here,

108
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.889
and see which flowers they sell and the customers they serve.

109
00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.430
You have to come up with a concept.

110
00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.529
I should figure out...

111
00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:06.570
how much flowers and raw materials will cost.

112
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.329
That way, I'll know how much I need a month.

113
00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:10.399
Exactly.

114
00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.000
I wrote down some basic notes.

115
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.070
(Related materials for opening a flower shop)

116
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.779
(Marketing is key.)

117
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.880
Can you do it by yourself?

118
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.690
Will you come with me?

119
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.120
I'll try my best,

120
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.889
but my show is airing soon. I don't have a lot of time.

121
00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:42.670
- You came again? - Yes. I saw your mother.

122
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.940
I have to go work now.

123
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.370
I'll go inside to work.

124
00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.010
What did you two talk about?

125
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.979
She wants me to come along to do the legwork.

126
00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.250
Don't go. You don't have time.

127
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.620
It's her first business.

128
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.690
She'd feel more comfortable to have someone with her.

129
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.729
If you want to save me time, you can go around with her.

130
00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:12.130
Me and Mom?

131
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.070
We'd fight the whole time.

132
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.940
That won't make you two split up, so it's okay to fight.

133
00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:20.610
I read your column on Good Soup.

134
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.110
A CEO must be busy.

135
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.079
What's the fuss about a column?

136
00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:27.950
This is not necessary.

137
00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:32.219
You'll receive a certification of contents for defamation.

138
00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:35.119
Are you blackmailing me?

139
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.920
No, we're talking.

140
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:40.190
I won't surrender to injustice.

141
00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:44.800
Then instead of surrendering,

142
00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.499
would you accept it if it was a deal?

143
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.570
A deal?

144
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.680
(Location)

145
00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:06.890
Ms. Ji,

146
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.089
we must be shooting at a location that's not on the script tomorrow.

147
00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:12.859
Gosh. I knew this would happen.

148
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.999
(Director Min Yi Bok)

149
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.599
("High Society")

150
00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:29.009
(Ji Hong Ah)

151
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:35.079
- Hello? - Director Min.

152
00:09:35.349 --> 00:09:38.320
Are you shooting it the way you want since you didn't sign the contract?

153
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.089
What's wrong?

154
00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:43.119
Some things have to be changed on the go.

155
00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:45.820
Come to the office. I have to talk to you.

156
00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:49.129
After that, I'll see if you can still change things your way.

157
00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:52.259
Hello?

158
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.900
She drives me crazy.

159
00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.869
Yes. Hello.

160
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:07.079
I'm busy. Why did you want to see me?

161
00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:14.890
It's a contract to say you're held responsible if you touch my script.

162
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.050
What is this?

163
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.619
You thought it was over because you didn't sign anything?

164
00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:26.060
If you work with me,

165
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.729
you'll get to experience a lot of strange things.

166
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.599
You're ahead of yourself.

167
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.940
I like your script.

168
00:10:34.109 --> 00:10:36.209
Ms. Lee and I just don't get along.

169
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.479
Then will you shoot it the way it is?

170
00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:40.550
(Recorded audio)

171
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.320
I will this time.

172
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.619
I got this audio file notarized.

173
00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:51.259
It has legal force.

174
00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:58.759
- Let's get married. - Director Min!

175
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.229
I want to be protected legally.

176
00:11:02.369 --> 00:11:04.400
Ms. Ji.

177
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.170
You win.

178
00:11:46.849 --> 00:11:48.680
It's so cold.

179
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.320
Why are you eating my food?

180
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.119
It tastes better that way.

181
00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:01.530
I hate people like that.

182
00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:05.060
Don't be cheap with food.

183
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.430
Fine, I won't eat it.

184
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:08.670
You have a weak mind.

185
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.540
You won't eat it just because I said that?

186
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.170
You're always playing hard to get.

187
00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:19.410
By the way,

188
00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:22.979
why are you out here at this hour?

189
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.920
Chef On is over.

190
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.589
Ever since they got back together, he's over all the time.

191
00:12:29.489 --> 00:12:31.589
Whenever I see the two of them...

192
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.259
You want to be in love, right?

193
00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:37.759
I do, but I don't want to date.

194
00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:40.129
We're dating already.

195
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.969
I don't know about the love part.

196
00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:46.540
Stop eating it. Get your own.

197
00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:49.040
It's so good.

198
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.959
(Sous chef)

199
00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:12.729
(Make sauces, check ingredients, check line cooks...)

200
00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:18.140
It's the sous chef who comes to work before anyone?

201
00:13:18.469 --> 00:13:20.770
Yes. The chef comes in last.

202
00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:24.709
I feel bad for Kyung.

203
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:26.810
She keeps going out because I'm here.

204
00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:29.979
You don't have to be sorry.

205
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.520
It gives her an excuse to go out and meet Joon Ha.

206
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.150
Are they dating?

207
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.459
No, but they keep on seeing each other.

208
00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:39.290
What is that?

209
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:40.829
Love.

210
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.430
But I feel like the two of them don't realize it.

211
00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.570
Is that possible?

212
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.099
The world is full of diverse people.

213
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.499
That includes you and me.

214
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.339
And your mother and my parents.

215
00:13:57.739 --> 00:13:59.810
Thank you for accepting my mom.

216
00:14:09.834 --> 00:14:13.066
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E39 Temperature of Love "I Know What You Did Yesterday"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

217
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.239
(3 months later)

218
00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:30.940
"You could fall in love with a man you don't know."

219
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.879
That's where I started from.

220
00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:36.920
I was surprised at how much people loved it.

221
00:14:37.479 --> 00:14:40.390
That's because the drama has artistic value.

222
00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:43.119
You almost got 15 percent in viewership.

223
00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:47.060
Yes. It's hard to go over 10 percent these days.

224
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.759
Since the protagonist is a writer,

225
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.959
some people say that the story is about your own experiences.

226
00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:56.869
Yes. I assume...

227
00:14:57.239 --> 00:14:59.640
some characteristics of mine were in Yeon Woo.

228
00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:02.339
Not at all.

229
00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:06.709
My personality...

230
00:15:06.849 --> 00:15:09.249
is a lot weaker than that of my protagonist.

231
00:15:09.349 --> 00:15:10.950
I get hurt easily.

232
00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:13.349
By the way,

233
00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:16.520
why is the writer so beautiful?

234
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.119
Thank you.

235
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.329
How does it feel for your debut series to be successful?

236
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.369
I think I deserved it for working hard.

237
00:15:41.349 --> 00:15:43.150
(On Entertainment Signs with Gerney Studios.)

238
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.450
Why aren't you here yet?

239
00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:49.650
I'm about to leave.

240
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.890
Is everyone there?

241
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.290
Jung Woo isn't here yet, but Hong Ah is here.

242
00:15:58.329 --> 00:15:59.599
This might sound awkward,

243
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.270
but why haven't you thanked me?

244
00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:06.440
You should be the one thanking me.

245
00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:08.509
You have an old-fashioned taste,

246
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.739
but we were successful thanks to my trendy taste.

247
00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:16.280
You're really going to get more arrogant.

248
00:16:16.349 --> 00:16:18.950
You always got your way even when you were just starting.

249
00:16:19.349 --> 00:16:21.150
Now, you've got wings on you.

250
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.359
I won't throw you away, though.

251
00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:28.459
Thank you.

252
00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:33.369
Soo Jung.

253
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.940
Yes?

254
00:16:36.969 --> 00:16:40.009
Can you recommend another kind of wine?

255
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.910
How about champagne?

256
00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:43.709
We have one that has a wonderful scent.

257
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:46.810
Since it's a celebration today, it'll work well.

258
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.709
I'd like that.

259
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.489
Soo Jung, is there anything to note for the reservation?

260
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.829
No.

261
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:16.840
Where are you going? Ms. Ji.

262
00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:28.289
What is this? Why are you coming together?

263
00:17:28.719 --> 00:17:30.360
- We met over there. - I saw him here.

264
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.160
Okay. So you met on your way.

265
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.660
It's just a matter of here or there.

266
00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:42.900
I've never had such a relationship in the 35 years of my life.

267
00:17:44.069 --> 00:17:45.100
What?

268
00:17:45.469 --> 00:17:47.340
Same with me.

269
00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:51.209
Go up first. I'm going to the washroom.

270
00:17:51.479 --> 00:17:52.539
Okay.

271
00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.350
What's wrong?

272
00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:05.459
Hyun Soo.

273
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.400
I think I really liked Won Joon.

274
00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:14.569
No. I loved him.

275
00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:20.110
I can't end it with him.

276
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.940
Everyone tells me I'm great,

277
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.110
but I feel like the same, old me.

278
00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:30.019
So?

279
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.850
So what?

280
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.049
Are you going to keep crying?

281
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.160
Then what can I do?

282
00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:44.100
You already know what to do.

283
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.799
There's no way you don't know.

284
00:19:01.249 --> 00:19:02.350
You're a little late.

285
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.719
I sent you the opening invitation over a week ago.

286
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.620
Timing never works for us.

287
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.059
Don't nag at me. I just got here.

288
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.719
I came to fulfill my duty.

289
00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:16.229
You're younger than me, but you look older.

290
00:19:16.729 --> 00:19:19.029
Look at all that Grey hair. Dye them.

291
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.440
Here.

292
00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:28.809
Did you put in a lot?

293
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.080
I put in enough.

294
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:34.150
Are you going to see Jung Sun?

295
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.479
What did you say to him to make him awkward with me?

296
00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:38.850
Don't blame me.

297
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.390
You never even visited him when he was growing up.

298
00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:46.630
Did you know that he got a Michelin star?

299
00:19:46.959 --> 00:19:50.059
His restaurant is doing well, and he goes out for lectures.

300
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360
He was even in advertisements.

301
00:19:51.499 --> 00:19:53.299
I know, Yoon Sun told me.

302
00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:55.029
She loves her brother.

303
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.739
I don't know your daughter's name.

304
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.739
You bother me just as much as you did back then.

305
00:20:02.209 --> 00:20:03.440
I better go.

306
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.340
Even if we don't get along,

307
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.709
you shouldn't be like that with Jung Sun.

308
00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:10.350
Who opened this shop for you?

309
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.779
Don't change the subject.

310
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.249
You always do that when you're cornered.

311
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.860
Do you want tea?

312
00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:21.360
What's gotten into you?

313
00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:24.160
Seeing how much you've aged makes me feel better.

314
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.269
Hello.

315
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.110
Here you go. Your wife will love it.

316
00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:35.569
Thank you.

317
00:20:39.309 --> 00:20:41.549
You should say something on a day like today.

318
00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.620
That's too old-fashioned. I won't say anything.

319
00:20:44.749 --> 00:20:47.319
Why are you doing this to me? Do it for me.

320
00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:50.219
I became a successful director this time.

321
00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:52.620
The Asian Drama Awards...

322
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.630
invited both of your dramas.

323
00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:56.759
Congratulations.

324
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.430
Really?

325
00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:00.499
- No way! - Oh, my!

326
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.100
Are we going abroad?

327
00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.979
It's Chef On's special menu.

328
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.580
It's chicken and beer.

329
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:16.350
Tell him I thanked him.

330
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.549
Tell him to come out. He should celebrate with us.

331
00:21:19.749 --> 00:21:20.819
Okay.

332
00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:22.289
I'm already out.

333
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.219
I will join as Hyun Soo's boyfriend.

334
00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:33.469
Did you two fight?

335
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:35.729
No.

336
00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:38.600
You always act close in front of others when you fight.

337
00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:41.469
No, you're wrong.

338
00:21:41.469 --> 00:21:43.880
That denial sounds like you fought.

339
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.739
I agree.

340
00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.610
Should I talk about what happened in the washroom?

341
00:21:47.749 --> 00:21:49.719
What? What happened in there?

342
00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:50.749
Did something happen?

343
00:21:53.249 --> 00:21:54.620
Shall we raise our glasses?

344
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.390
We shouldn't end it like this.

345
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.289
Here. Let's all live well.

346
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.759
Sometimes, give glances to your neighbors.

347
00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:05.130
- Okay. - Cheers.

348
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.769
- Cheers. - Cheers.

349
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.670
- I brought the car. - I'll drive then.

350
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.110
I'll drive. It's my car.

351
00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:15.009
Can't I make things easier for you?

352
00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:16.580
Get on.

353
00:22:16.709 --> 00:22:19.479
Can we walk? I'll bring the car to you tomorrow.

354
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:20.610
It's cold.

355
00:22:21.209 --> 00:22:23.450
We haven't seen each other in a week...

356
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.680
when we live in the same neighborhood.

357
00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:26.819
I've been busy.

358
00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:29.890
You were busy while the drama was airing too. Come on.

359
00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.830
Let's walk. Are you happy?

360
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.029
Not yet.

361
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.969
- What are you doing tomorrow? - It's cold tomorrow.

362
00:22:48.969 --> 00:22:50.140
Stop that.

363
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.140
What?

364
00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.880
I told you we should take the car.

365
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.209
You must be getting old.

366
00:22:55.979 --> 00:22:58.319
Why would you bring that up?

367
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.090
You weren't like this last year.

368
00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:04.120
You didn't spend last winter with me.

369
00:23:04.819 --> 00:23:07.690
Whom did you spend it with? How can you confuse her with me?

370
00:23:11.229 --> 00:23:12.360
Why are you laughing?

371
00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:14.400
To celebrate my success at making you jealous.

372
00:23:14.969 --> 00:23:16.940
You celebrate the strangest things.

373
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.209
- Gosh. - It's really cold.

374
00:23:20.969 --> 00:23:23.080
Can I drink something warm before I go?

375
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.640
- No. - Why not?

376
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.739
I won't give you anything.

377
00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:26.979
Come on.

378
00:23:31.979 --> 00:23:33.219
What? What did you see?

379
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.519
- Something good. - Something good?

380
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.120
Who?

381
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.620
Let's go.

382
00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:51.170
I told you to stop.

383
00:23:53.709 --> 00:23:55.969
Stop what? We did everything already.

384
00:23:55.969 --> 00:23:57.739
Hyun Soo saw me.

385
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.610
There's some on your cheek.

386
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.920
I said, stop it.

387
00:24:29.469 --> 00:24:30.509
What are you doing?

388
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.610
I'm staring at you.

389
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.390
Why are you staring at me?

390
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.289
Because you might not like it if I approached you.

391
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.200
You can come closer.

392
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.809
Have you been well?

393
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.420
I haven't been well.

394
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.390
Why not?

395
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.249
You weren't there.

396
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:20.229
I can't forget you.

397
00:25:20.989 --> 00:25:22.190
It's strange.

398
00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:26.400
You shouldn't feel pressured.

399
00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:30.239
You can do as you please.

400
00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:21.019
What's wrong today? What's happening?

401
00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:23.059
- I don't know. - You don't know?

402
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.890
I told you we should take the car.

403
00:26:25.989 --> 00:26:27.459
You wanted to walk, and look what happened.

404
00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:30.900
We should do it too. On a day like this, we should do the same.

405
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.469
Why should we? No.

406
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.529
Where are you going?

407
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.739
I have a home, but I can't go.

408
00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.850
What should we do?

409
00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:50.019
I need to go to the company early tomorrow because of the contract.

410
00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:52.319
You should sleep here and leave early tomorrow.

411
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:55.049
Do you think Joon Ho left?

412
00:26:56.019 --> 00:26:58.019
If he had, he'd have called.

413
00:26:58.489 --> 00:26:59.620
Right.

414
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.660
What do you think about living in the same house?

415
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.400
It'll save time if we live together.

416
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.400
It's better than moving from one house to another.

417
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:16.580
You want to live together to save time?

418
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.809
Do you really think that is the only reason?

419
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.809
No, I just wanted to hear you say it again.

420
00:27:24.719 --> 00:27:28.019
I couldn't see you often when you were working on the drama.

421
00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:30.219
You said you were going to start the next script right away.

422
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.029
I don't want a wedding.

423
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.860
What?

424
00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:37.860
Then?

425
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.600
We could have dinner with our family members and introduce each other.

426
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.469
Let's do as you want.

427
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:50.279
I just want to live with you.

428
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.910
All right.

429
00:28:12.959 --> 00:28:14.299
You should take the next lift.

430
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:17.370
Really?

431
00:28:17.569 --> 00:28:20.709
Aren't you going to regret this? Why were we meeting today again?

432
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.110
- Get in. - It's fine. I'll take the next one.

433
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.180
Hyun Soo.

434
00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:30.180
Please get in.

435
00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:33.190
It's only because you asked nicely.

436
00:28:36.719 --> 00:28:39.090
- Did you have breakfast? - I'm not signing the contract.

437
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.459
Hyun Soo, let's not do this.

438
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.130
I lost my respect for you when I saw you closing the elevator doors.

439
00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:48.969
You must have been offered a better contract.

440
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.440
I was offered better conditions in the past too.

441
00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.080
Gosh, I feel so light.

442
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.350
I wasn't sure how I'd say this to you.

443
00:29:01.979 --> 00:29:05.180
Prepare tea for us. Get the best. Bring some snacks too.

444
00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:06.590
This way.

445
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.989
You should consider it. Let's talk after you look at it.

446
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.029
I'll take a look.

447
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.430
I was sure you were going to take it. Why aren't you?

448
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.100
Did we do something wrong?

449
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.969
It's not about what you did.

450
00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:29.110
But I'm just wondering if working with only one company...

451
00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:31.140
is a good thing.

452
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.940
Why would you think about that?

453
00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:36.479
- We worked together and succeeded. - We did.

454
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.650
Now I, have the right to choose to fail.

455
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.660
- Hyun Soo. - Hello, Hong Ah.

456
00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:53.870
- Are you here about the contract? - Yes.

457
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.940
- Are you going to take it? - I don't know. How about you?

458
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.140
I'm going to take it if the conditions are okay.

459
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.969
I see.

460
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.779
What's this?

461
00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:07.549
Well...

462
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.120
I know what you did yesterday.

463
00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:15.690
I'm going.

464
00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:19.789
Hyun Soo.

465
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.729
Where are you going?

466
00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:24.700
I'm going to visit my mom.

467
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.269
- Aren't you finished yet? - No.

468
00:30:35.069 --> 00:30:36.840
It's been here for 20 years.

469
00:30:37.209 --> 00:30:39.509
It's taking a while to unpack.

470
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.709
Gosh.

471
00:30:41.979 --> 00:30:43.080
(Lee Hyun Yi)

472
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.680
This belongs to Hyun Yi.

473
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.120
It's not just our belongings. There are our children's as well.

474
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:50.759
They've been here for a long time.

475
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.830
We were both too busy living our lives that we just left them here.

476
00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:00.830
Why did we live such busy lives?

477
00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:02.130
Honey.

478
00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:09.239
Who could it be?

479
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.640
- Welcome. - Mom. Dad.

480
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.709
- Hello. - You're here now that work is done.

481
00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:19.019
I haven't been faithful to you as your daughter for a while.

482
00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:23.319
- Did you have lunch? - Not yet.

483
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.360
- Let's order something. - Great.

484
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:28.729
I bought some carrot cake that Mom likes.

485
00:31:28.729 --> 00:31:30.459
- Oh, my. - It's pretty.

486
00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:33.769
Dad, what is that?

487
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:37.440
Dad found it while he was cleaning up.

488
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.209
How did this end up here?

489
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.840
This was in the luggage...

490
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.309
that Hyun Yi sent home when she got married. It's yours.

491
00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:48.180
Yes, it's for me.

492
00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:51.620
But why did she send it to you, not me?

493
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.049
You weren't on speaking terms after the fight.

494
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.920
It's a bit late, but congratulations on winning the contest.

495
00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:34.890
Now that you've achieved your dream, enjoy. From On Jung Sun.

496
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.330
(From On Jung Sun)

497
00:32:58.219 --> 00:33:00.049
I like Yeouido.

498
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.059
I said that if I won the contest,

499
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.390
I'd dance at the Yeouido Park.

500
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.489
I don't think I'll be able to.

501
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.809
What do you think?

502
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.880
- What? - Do you think you can dance?

503
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.719
Why so suddenly?

504
00:33:33.719 --> 00:33:36.690
You should practice the dance moves before you win the contest.

505
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.819
Gosh, you must be crazy.

506
00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:40.059
Aren't you yet?

507
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.690
How can you succeed if you're not crazy?

508
00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:48.029
I didn't say I wasn't crazy. I am. I'm crazy.

509
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.900
But no dancing.

510
00:34:27.376 --> 00:34:30.276
