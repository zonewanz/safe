00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:09.307
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:14.376
I took care of the desks and chairs as you didn't want them.

3
00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:17.317
I left the rest of your belongings with the security.

4
00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:26.087
Thank you. Have a good day.

5
00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:31.297
Who is it?

6
00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:33.366
My gosh.

7
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.536
(President Jang Ki Bong)

8
00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.466
I presume things are coming to an end with "We Got Married".

9
00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:42.737
I didn't know Anthony wanted to drop out of the show.

10
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:47.146
Have you heard any gossips recently?

11
00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.686
Have you heard any news from the tabloids or anything?

12
00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:53.086
What? How would you know anything about that?

13
00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.686
Even I heard it yesterday.

14
00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:56.417
So you didn't do anything despite your knowledge?

15
00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.887
I was going to tell you, but... Hang on.

16
00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:01.497
It's right here.

17
00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.267
(Synopsis: "Where the Wind Stops")

18
00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:09.597
But where did you hear that?

19
00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:13.976
Yang Jeong Woo fell from a horse. He can't continue filming now.

20
00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:17.146
The production company told me not to breathe a word of this.

21
00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:21.916
Ms. Choi, I had no idea you had that many friends in this industry.

22
00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.847
The synopsis is great. Jin Jin is going to star in it too.

23
00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:29.756
If he does a good job with filling in for the role,

24
00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.056
he's going to make it big with this film.

25
00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:33.427
I'm not sure...

26
00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.496
if we want to work with Jin Jin.

27
00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:39.526
I see.

28
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.407
I mean... Why did you bring it up?

29
00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.577
They don't have time to hold auditions.

30
00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:50.677
They asked about Anthony. I told them he's a good actor.

31
00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:53.547
You don't even know that. Forget it.

32
00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:56.677
What's the role?

33
00:01:57.286 --> 00:02:00.047
A bodyguard. This is about finding a mummy's husband.

34
00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:02.457
He might be the husband of the mummy.

35
00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:06.927
Do you not like the role?

36
00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:10.626
It's not that.

37
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.566
Well, should we at least have a meeting?

38
00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.507
Yes. Have the meeting at least.

39
00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.336
But did you find me anyone who wants to share the space?

40
00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:22.477
I'm still looking.

41
00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:23.846
I've been waiting.

42
00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.577
I didn't hear any updates.

43
00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:29.346
Whatever. You need to take responsibility for this.

44
00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:33.116
- Why would I? - You said you'll find me someone.

45
00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:36.387
If there's no one by the end of this week, we're sharing the space.

46
00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.857
Do you know how much monetary loss...

47
00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.626
I suffered because of you?

48
00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:43.727
You lost money because of me? How did that happen?

49
00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:45.197
Do you not know?

50
00:02:45.327 --> 00:02:48.066
Look at this space. I'm paying maintenance fee all alone.

51
00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:52.806
- Are you always this unreasonable? - I don't know. Whatever!

52
00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:55.276
I wouldn't know since I didn't stay in school!

53
00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:58.306
Ms. Choi, you should just move into this building.

54
00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.047
Come on, answer me!

55
00:03:03.477 --> 00:03:06.686
Okay, fine. I'll move in. Are you happy now?

56
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.887
Thank you. I'm going now.

57
00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:27.066
Hey. Did you find out anything about the illustrator?

58
00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:30.646
I did, but I couldn't find any personal information.

59
00:03:31.207 --> 00:03:35.917
The artist sent us a sample from a convenience store in Seogwipo.

60
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.746
I guess the artist must've sent it from there.

61
00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:40.917
- As in Jeju Island? - Yes.

62
00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:42.216
What about a phone number?

63
00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:44.757
We called the number, but it's not in service anymore.

64
00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.987
The advertising team tried to look into the artist,

65
00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:49.757
but the social media is the only means of contact.

66
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:55.366
But you know I'm better than that.

67
00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.366
My dear Manager Kim.

68
00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:02.836
A little while ago, we sent one of our products to the artist.

69
00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:04.246
Really? What's the address?

70
00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:05.577
But this is the weird part.

71
00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:07.947
- To where did they send it? - To a school.

72
00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:09.917
It was sent to Youngin Elementary School.

73
00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:13.816
That's not in Jeju Island.

74
00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.186
"Youngin Elementary School"?

75
00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.246
- Hi. - Hello.

76
00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:46.616
Are you okay?

77
00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:47.956
Yes, I'm fine.

78
00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:50.016
Why did you do that? Remember we're friends now.

79
00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:51.787
I got it. My gosh.

80
00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:04.167
Why would you...

81
00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.566
Why did you put the wrapper into your bag again?

82
00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:08.936
I didn't throw it out on the street or anything.

83
00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:11.946
You should just carry a trash can with you.

84
00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:13.777
Ah Reum, let me see your bag.

85
00:05:13.777 --> 00:05:16.717
Don't even think about it. Why are you inspecting my bag?

86
00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.946
Let's go back to how things were before.

87
00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:20.886
That's what I'm doing now.

88
00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:23.487
So am I.

89
00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:26.287
My goodness. How stubborn. Fine.

90
00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:29.326
Why would you keep trash in your bag?

91
00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.737
- Is that interesting? - Yes, it is.

92
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:38.607
Hold on.

93
00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:42.677
No.

94
00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:47.516
Thank you.

95
00:05:51.816 --> 00:05:54.217
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

96
00:05:54.657 --> 00:05:58.256
You like cow, pig, chicken,

97
00:05:58.386 --> 00:06:00.597
and me, a new addition to the list.

98
00:06:02.297 --> 00:06:06.496
After we eat the chicken, we must mix the rice in. Non-negotiable.

99
00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:07.636
Okay.

100
00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:10.936
This is so glutinous.

101
00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:13.066
Oh, no. Did it get on your coat?

102
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:16.477
No, no. It splattered on the table.

103
00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:18.706
- I'm fine. - Okay.

104
00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:20.777
All right...

105
00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:23.946
- Are you okay? - Yes.

106
00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.386
I'm fine.

107
00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:30.886
You should enjoy the food like you'd normally do.

108
00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:33.756
Don't mind me at all. I'm okay.

109
00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:36.027
Ma'am! Excuse me.

110
00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:37.996
Why did you call her?

111
00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:53.946
- Try it. - Okay.

112
00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.717
This is me, the most considerate friend.

113
00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:00.717
That's true. Thank you, Ah Reum.

114
00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:02.186
I'm going to enjoy this.

115
00:07:02.186 --> 00:07:03.556
This is good.

116
00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:09.326
For the seven years my mother suffered from Alzheimer's,

117
00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:11.826
my older brother had never come to visit her.

118
00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:14.936
Forget about visiting her. He never even called once.

119
00:07:15.237 --> 00:07:18.366
And I took care of all her treatment bills.

120
00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:21.506
Even if he neither contacted nor supported your mother,

121
00:07:21.737 --> 00:07:24.107
the inheritance would be divided equally between you and him.

122
00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:27.616
However, according to Article 1008 of the Civil Code,

123
00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:31.186
your financial support for her will be considered as contribution,

124
00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:34.087
and you may receive additional inheritance.

125
00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:38.186
- That means that there's a way. - Yes.

126
00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:43.727
By the way, how should I pay for the consultation fee?

127
00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:45.167
You can just...

128
00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:51.766
It's 100 dollars an hour.

129
00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:53.407
I see.

130
00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.277
Lawyer Jang.

131
00:08:07.756 --> 00:08:11.857
(You May or May Not Pay to Receive Legal Advice.)

132
00:08:12.456 --> 00:08:13.927
- Lawyer Jang. - Yes.

133
00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:15.756
Have you prepared the documents...

134
00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:17.196
- regarding the industrial accident? - Yes.

135
00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:20.366
Did you categorize precedents for the child support case?

136
00:08:20.397 --> 00:08:21.467
Yes.

137
00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:24.706
And how about fried chicken and beer for dinner tonight?

138
00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.177
- What? - I think I've sobered up.

139
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:31.777
- I'll buy dinner. - Okay.

140
00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:34.677
Mr. Kang, how about...

141
00:08:34.777 --> 00:08:37.186
Instead of drinks...

142
00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:40.346
How about we have a meal instead?

143
00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:42.986
I like the atmosphere when people drink.

144
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.726
It's fun.

145
00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:48.956
If you don't want beer, how about soju?

146
00:08:48.956 --> 00:08:50.297
No.

147
00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:53.726
I like beer very much. Let's have beer.

148
00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:55.537
- Right? - Right.

149
00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:04.647
Gosh, it's so cold.

150
00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:07.417
- You feel cold too? - Yes, I do.

151
00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.686
Right, just a moment.

152
00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:14.657
My favorite song right now.

153
00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:16.956
Do you want to hear it?

154
00:09:19.186 --> 00:09:22.897
Okay... Just a minute.

155
00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.767
One for me.

156
00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:40.946
My eardrum...

157
00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:45.816
Old man, we really are not a match.

158
00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:48.787
Why are we not a match?

159
00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:51.757
I was just surprised because the music started suddenly.

160
00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.056
I like songs like this.

161
00:09:53.056 --> 00:09:54.696
- You do? - Of course.

162
00:09:59.397 --> 00:10:01.566
- Isn't it nice? - It's nice.

163
00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:02.767
Isn't it nice?

164
00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:05.966
Is that how the dance goes?

165
00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:09.936
Isn't this better than the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra?

166
00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:11.377
- It's upbeat. - Isn't it?

167
00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.507
Yes. Is this a Korean song?

168
00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.216
- What? - Is this Korean?

169
00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:16.476
- It's a Korean song. - Is it?

170
00:10:16.476 --> 00:10:19.047
- Don't you know this song? - I... I do.

171
00:10:19.047 --> 00:10:20.757
I think I know it.

172
00:10:25.456 --> 00:10:27.157
Youngin Elementary School.

173
00:10:27.157 --> 00:10:29.397
It's not in Jeju Island.

174
00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.867
It's a small school in Hadong, South Gyeongsang Province.

175
00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:37.206
Jeju Island?

176
00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:39.706
Hadong?

177
00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:44.677
Is this Lee Chul Min?

178
00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:48.216
This is Jeju Island. I met you and Sa Jin Jin.

179
00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:51.287
- Do you remember me? - Yes, of course.

180
00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:53.716
The pretty lady you asked about.

181
00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:55.586
You told me to call if I had news.

182
00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:58.186
- I called about her. - Oh, okay.

183
00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.696
She ordered mandarins from my neighbor.

184
00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:02.696
She wanted them sent to...

185
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.527
Hadong, Gyeongsang Province.

186
00:11:05.527 --> 00:11:08.767
Hadong in Gyeongsang Province? Where in Hadong?

187
00:11:10.297 --> 00:11:12.367
(Sa Jin Jin)

188
00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:17.306
(Sa Jin Jin)

189
00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:28.186
(Ji Won)

190
00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:29.257
(Call)

191
00:11:29.257 --> 00:11:30.456
(Ji Won)

192
00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:33.657
Does that help?

193
00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:36.397
Yes, of course. Thanks a lot.

194
00:11:36.397 --> 00:11:37.466
Bye.

195
00:11:56.117 --> 00:11:57.287
Mom.

196
00:11:57.946 --> 00:11:59.086
Are you going out?

197
00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.586
Yes, to have a beer with Hong Hee and Mi Dal.

198
00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:03.586
Hong Hee never gets to drink when we go out.

199
00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:06.226
Good for you. Buy them something nice.

200
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.127
- Will Hong Hee come for you? - No, I'll call a taxi.

201
00:12:09.797 --> 00:12:12.826
- Could you give me a ride? - What?

202
00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:15.066
Just to the crossroads. It's not that far.

203
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.322
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E26 20th Century Boy & Girl "Love Cosmos"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

204
00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:50.566
- Mom. - Yes?

205
00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:52.537
What's wrong?

206
00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:59.507
What's wrong? What is it?

207
00:13:01.017 --> 00:13:02.647
My eyes...

208
00:13:03.747 --> 00:13:06.446
- aren't right. - Your eyes?

209
00:13:06.647 --> 00:13:07.887
I have...

210
00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:10.287
glaucoma.

211
00:13:14.257 --> 00:13:17.326
Then... What will happen?

212
00:13:17.326 --> 00:13:20.267
My eyesight will get worse and worse.

213
00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:22.267
There's nothing to worry.

214
00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:28.236
Why didn't you tell me?

215
00:13:28.777 --> 00:13:30.206
You should have told me.

216
00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:33.976
I'm playing it up. I'm just exaggerating.

217
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:37.517
I guess you're all grown up.

218
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:40.017
I get to whine to you now.

219
00:13:42.387 --> 00:13:46.127
Tell the truth. Tell me the truth.

220
00:13:49.797 --> 00:13:51.196
Jin Jin.

221
00:13:53.527 --> 00:13:57.167
Do you know what I fear the most?

222
00:13:58.836 --> 00:14:01.177
It's you, my own kids.

223
00:14:02.806 --> 00:14:04.547
Even if I'm robbed,

224
00:14:04.547 --> 00:14:06.377
threatened with a knife,

225
00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:07.617
or in a war,

226
00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:09.946
I wouldn't fear a thing.

227
00:14:10.547 --> 00:14:11.716
But...

228
00:14:13.517 --> 00:14:15.356
I'm afraid of you.

229
00:14:17.017 --> 00:14:19.287
I gave birth to you all...

230
00:14:19.287 --> 00:14:21.726
and raised you myself,

231
00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:25.066
but nothing scares me more than you do.

232
00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.236
But now,

233
00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:31.537
I found something that scares me more.

234
00:14:36.537 --> 00:14:39.946
Not being able to see your pretty faces.

235
00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:45.247
I'm scared I'll end up not being able to see your faces.

236
00:14:45.446 --> 00:14:46.917
So...

237
00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:50.117
I'll get treated,

238
00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:53.326
take my medicine, and get surgery.

239
00:14:53.686 --> 00:14:55.856
I'll do everything I can.

240
00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:04.637
So you don't have to make that face.

241
00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:06.836
Don't.

242
00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:10.076
You're a good girl.

243
00:15:27.856 --> 00:15:29.257
Jin Jin.

244
00:15:29.257 --> 00:15:31.997
What's wrong with my face?

245
00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:35.037
It's cleansing oil. It's to wipe your makeup off.

246
00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:39.206
I'm getting old. I can't see properly.

247
00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:43.507
Mom, why don't you wash the cups properly?

248
00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:51.846
(Oil, Toner)

249
00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:52.986
(Cream)

250
00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.627
(Moisture Cream)

251
00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:09.997
(Essence)

252
00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:17.007
Jin Jin.

253
00:16:27.816 --> 00:16:29.617
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:16:29.617 --> 00:16:31.986
Why didn't you tell me?

255
00:16:33.997 --> 00:16:36.456
Why did you make me look like a fool?

256
00:16:40.836 --> 00:16:42.367
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:47.436
My mom's sick.

258
00:16:49.106 --> 00:16:51.677
I feel so sorry for her.

259
00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:56.946
There's nothing I can do for her.

260
00:16:59.346 --> 00:17:00.586
There is.

261
00:17:07.996 --> 00:17:09.597
Let's go.

262
00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:13.067
To find your sister.

263
00:17:14.397 --> 00:17:16.996
Let's go find Ho Sung.

264
00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:33.046
It's hers. I think it's her drawing.

265
00:17:33.046 --> 00:17:35.716
I found out the address she uses to receive parcels.

266
00:17:36.117 --> 00:17:38.657
Chul Min got a call from someone in Jeju Island.

267
00:17:39.657 --> 00:17:42.557
- Where is she? - A school in Hadong.

268
00:17:42.557 --> 00:17:45.567
If we leave now, we'll arrive when the school opens.

269
00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:53.877
She's alive.

270
00:17:57.946 --> 00:17:59.706
I'll make her pay.

271
00:18:18.167 --> 00:18:20.067
This must not be it.

272
00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:24.867
It's okay. We can just turn back. Don't worry.

273
00:18:34.817 --> 00:18:35.877
What?

274
00:18:39.347 --> 00:18:40.456
What's wrong?

275
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.057
Just a moment.

276
00:19:00.236 --> 00:19:01.577
Oh no.

277
00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:10.147
The battery died.

278
00:19:13.716 --> 00:19:16.087
(No service)

279
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:22.627
Jin Jin, I'll go and get help. Wait in the car for a bit.

280
00:19:23.327 --> 00:19:24.667
No, I'm scared.

281
00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:30.506
Then count 100 giraffes very slowly. I'll be right back.

282
00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:32.867
- No. - Will you stay here all night?

283
00:19:34.077 --> 00:19:35.907
Okay, don't be long.

284
00:19:36.377 --> 00:19:37.776
Wait just a bit.

285
00:20:01.966 --> 00:20:03.067
One,

286
00:20:04.407 --> 00:20:05.436
two,

287
00:20:06.837 --> 00:20:07.907
three...

288
00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:09.307
Five,

289
00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:11.677
six...

290
00:20:12.476 --> 00:20:13.506
22,

291
00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:15.976
23...

292
00:20:16.946 --> 00:20:17.946
62,

293
00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:20.246
63...

294
00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:23.456
98,

295
00:20:25.627 --> 00:20:26.786
99...

296
00:20:50.587 --> 00:20:52.117
I found a house.

297
00:20:52.446 --> 00:20:53.647
Can you walk?

298
00:20:54.317 --> 00:20:55.387
Hang on.

299
00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:03.127
Watch your head.

300
00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:18.946
What are you two doing here so late at night?

301
00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:22.716
Sorry. We got lost, and my car broke down.

302
00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:26.046
Would you mind letting us stay the night?

303
00:21:26.387 --> 00:21:28.516
Sorry. There's no spare room.

304
00:21:29.317 --> 00:21:32.026
We didn't warm it up, so it's freezing.

305
00:21:32.127 --> 00:21:33.427
You can't sleep there.

306
00:21:34.496 --> 00:21:37.897
You'll have to sleep in our bedroom.

307
00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:40.226
We wouldn't mind though.

308
00:21:40.597 --> 00:21:42.036
Would it be all right?

309
00:21:50.107 --> 00:21:51.476
We don't mind.

310
00:22:16.567 --> 00:22:17.837
Sleep well.

311
00:22:55.776 --> 00:22:57.006
Jin Jin's...

312
00:22:59.046 --> 00:23:00.546
genuine,

313
00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:02.446
kind,

314
00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:05.716
wise, and warm.

315
00:23:12.286 --> 00:23:13.486
Come on.

316
00:23:13.587 --> 00:23:15.097
I feel tipsy.

317
00:23:16.296 --> 00:23:18.266
- Come on. - Wait.

318
00:23:19.266 --> 00:23:20.327
(Anthony fan meeting)

319
00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:23.337
Anthony, keep up.

320
00:23:27.337 --> 00:23:29.307
I bet she'll be watching.

321
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:32.607
It wasn't for long,

322
00:23:32.877 --> 00:23:35.117
but I'm grateful for the time I spent...

323
00:23:35.776 --> 00:23:38.647
as her husband. I was happy.

324
00:23:44.587 --> 00:23:45.786
From now on?

325
00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:49.427
I guess...

326
00:23:51.927 --> 00:23:53.996
I'll be her fan now.

327
00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:01.837
I clearly remember our first meeting.

328
00:24:07.847 --> 00:24:11.986
It was the moment my dream came true.

329
00:24:13.587 --> 00:24:17.226
I'd spent 20 years of my life smiling...

330
00:24:17.327 --> 00:24:19.427
and crying with him.

331
00:24:20.026 --> 00:24:23.327
He comforted me and gave me courage.

332
00:24:24.966 --> 00:24:27.167
Every single second we spent together...

333
00:24:27.796 --> 00:24:29.466
meant a lot to me.

334
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:35.107
From now on?

335
00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:38.246
I'll cheer him on.

336
00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:41.417
As I always did.

337
00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:50.117
(Thank you for supporting Anthony and Sa Jin Jin.)

338
00:25:09.137 --> 00:25:11.046
(Children of 20th Century/20th Century Boy & Girl)

339
00:25:11.147 --> 00:25:14.317
Her name's Sa Ho Sung, and she's in her late 30s.

340
00:25:14.317 --> 00:25:17.077
A young lady lives alone behind the sacred tree.

341
00:25:17.077 --> 00:25:20.317
Let's stop. I think I've had enough of the entertainment industry.

342
00:25:20.657 --> 00:25:21.917
Just one more job.

343
00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:23.986
- The bodyguard. - He's on his way.

344
00:25:24.087 --> 00:25:25.127
Who is it?

345
00:25:25.127 --> 00:25:27.927
Mom, when did you decide to get married?

346
00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:29.026
Come home.

347
00:25:29.026 --> 00:25:30.097
This is home.

348
00:25:30.097 --> 00:25:31.827
Come home. Mom's waiting.

349
00:25:31.827 --> 00:25:33.696
She got sick waiting for you.
