00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.580
(Episode 37)

2
00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.160
Out of the things I own,

3
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.599
if there is something that suits someone else better,

4
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.840
it's hard for me to keep it...

5
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.470
because it reminds me of that other person.

6
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.879
It still sounds corny.

7
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.279
You have to get a beating from me today.

8
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.379
Will that settle our debt?

9
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.919
Do you want to get hit first or get hit after the talk?

10
00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:50.020
I'll hear it first and try to avoid getting hit.

11
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.359
You didn't even know it was my birthday.

12
00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029
Do you want to return the birthday punch I gave you?

13
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.409
I made your 39th birthday memorable.

14
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.909
I'll never be able to forget your birthday either.

15
00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:40.639
Do you know why I liked you?

16
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.469
It's because you never got swayed.

17
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.180
I wanted to see if I could sway you.

18
00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.510
I thought...

19
00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:50.850
that you would change if you got swayed.

20
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.350
I respected you...

21
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.389
for not getting hurt even when you got rejected.

22
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.760
I feel like myself more than I've ever been.

23
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.029
That's how it is.

24
00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:05.760
You either become better by getting swayed,

25
00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.900
or you end up getting ruined.

26
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.000
I tried to find out the essential truth about the things I love.

27
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.139
Hyun Soo...

28
00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.010
never got swayed by me.

29
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.910
Congratulations.

30
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.280
She chose you,

31
00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.820
and I lost to that love.

32
00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.070
(Temperature of Love)

33
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.220
I'll see you at the office.

34
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.149
I'll go right after I meet Mother.

35
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.149
"Mother"?

36
00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.160
It feels awkward to call her that.

37
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.790
Then...

38
00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.929
stop calling her that.

39
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.799
You're not even married yet.

40
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.600
Don't you think you're getting too deeply involved?

41
00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.169
I don't know what will happen in the future.

42
00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.239
But I'm going to do what I want to do for now.

43
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.750
What brings you here?

44
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.549
Are you serious?

45
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.690
You should've told me what happened to your mother.

46
00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.790
I didn't know how I was supposed to tell you.

47
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.760
I was worried.

48
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.200
I contemplated on whether I should call your mother or not.

49
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.970
I thought you might not like it.

50
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.970
I'm still not good at doing this.

51
00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.339
I hesitated because I didn't want to worry you.

52
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.139
I guess I should've called you and told you that I hesitated.

53
00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.049
That's why I called your mother first.

54
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.950
I thought you might feel pressured if I asked you about it.

55
00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.720
Did I do a good job?

56
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.790
Yes, you did.

57
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
We should've been like this earlier. Then we wouldn't have fought.

58
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.560
Things became better because we fought.

59
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.430
The pain of having broken up with you for two weeks was bigger...

60
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.870
than the pain I felt during the five years of having stayed apart.

61
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.370
Hello.

62
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.010
Are you going to say that to me every time you see me?

63
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.839
Did you eat?

64
00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.610
Yes.

65
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.320
I want to refresh myself.

66
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.120
What would you like to do?

67
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.320
Can you do it with me?

68
00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.389
I can for two hours.

69
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.570
- It's my favorite color. - It looks good on you.

70
00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:34.940
- Here. - Okay.

71
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.209
Mother.

72
00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:40.510
Will you buy all these?

73
00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.320
Call me by my first name when we're outside.

74
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.550
Okay, Young Mi.

75
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.889
Young Mi.

76
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.659
Are you done with choosing what you like?

77
00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:57.099
Not yet. There is nothing pretty.

78
00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.329
The designs aren't good this season.

79
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.700
- Let's go. - Okay, Young Mi.

80
00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.110
- Thank you. I'm sorry. - It's all right.

81
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.920
Did you see those men looking at me?

82
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.849
Yes. They were looking at you.

83
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
Right?

84
00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.829
My popularity never dies.

85
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.060
I like hanging out with you because you're pretty.

86
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
You're pretty too.

87
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.370
Will you go home now?

88
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.110
Shopping isn't fun.

89
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.190
Mr. Park. Ms. Lee's mother is waiting for you inside.

90
00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.329
Did I come here too early?

91
00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.430
It's okay. Please sit down.

92
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.709
I made a new batch of citron tea.

93
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.539
I brought some for you.

94
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:20.880
Thank you.

95
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.920
Thanks for cherishing Hyun Soo.

96
00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:27.089
No problem.

97
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.789
Please keep looking after her.

98
00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:32.659
Isn't it wonderful to be working...

99
00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:33.959
in the same field?

100
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.899
Hyun Soo is an honest and loyal person.

101
00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.839
She'll be a good work partner to you.

102
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.310
Yes.

103
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.920
Welcome.

104
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.620
I enjoyed it last time, so I'm here again.

105
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.649
All right.

106
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.760
Aren't you getting more customers these days?

107
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320
Yes.

108
00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:09.060
I wrote a good review.

109
00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:10.500
Thank you.

110
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.899
Other restaurants usually pamper me if I do that.

111
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.890
(Lunch course: 2)

112
00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:37.690
Okay. Two more lunches.

113
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.190
- Yes, Chef. - Ha Sung.

114
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.060
- Isn't ceviche ready yet? - Coming up.

115
00:08:43.859 --> 00:08:46.859
Chef On. The order that just came in...

116
00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:49.200
is for the blogger who didn't pay last time.

117
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.070
What should I do?

118
00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:52.599
Go by the book.

119
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.709
Okay.

120
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:56.270
There.

121
00:08:57.709 --> 00:08:58.739
(Good Soup)

122
00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:00.310
(Add contact)

123
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.450
Yes, this is Good Soup.

124
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.920
I'd like to make a reservation for two for tomorrow.

125
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.459
I'm sorry. We're closed tomorrow.

126
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.459
We don't have any available spots until next week.

127
00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.469
I see.

128
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:27.009
Actually, I need to meet with Chef On,

129
00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:29.140
so I was going to eat there.

130
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.579
Is that right? May I have your name please?

131
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.810
Min Ho, give me pomegranate.

132
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:35.879
- Isn't it done yet? - It's done, Chef.

133
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:38.550
- It's done, Chef. - Okay.

134
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.520
Chef On. Ms. Lee's mother called.

135
00:09:55.969 --> 00:09:57.469
(Park Mi Na)

136
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:05.079
Hello?

137
00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.280
Hi, this is On Jung Sung.

138
00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:08.650
Hi, Chef On.

139
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.820
How are you?

140
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.920
I'm well. Thanks for asking.

141
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.820
Tell me when and how many people will be coming.

142
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.060
I'll try to make room for you.

143
00:10:17.489 --> 00:10:21.390
I was going to visit you tomorrow to thank you.

144
00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.089
Please come tomorrow no matter what.

145
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040
Are you late?

146
00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:43.209
Yes, a little bit. I was spending time with Mother.

147
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.050
"Mother"?

148
00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.150
Did you give up on your work?

149
00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:49.390
You can't waste time hanging out with Jung Sun's mom.

150
00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:51.020
I am working.

151
00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:53.420
Don't be so angry like that.

152
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.489
You have to do your best,

153
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:57.700
so that I can feel good when I win against you.

154
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.400
But look at you.

155
00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.369
All your focus is on a man.

156
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.400
Get a hold of yourself.

157
00:11:06.469 --> 00:11:08.140
Aren't you in love with Won Joon?

158
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.410
Why are you bringing him up?

159
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.249
Soo Jung is so cool.

160
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:17.150
How can she do that?

161
00:11:17.849 --> 00:11:21.020
I hated you when I liked Jung Sun.

162
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.890
I thought he didn't love me because of you.

163
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.560
But...

164
00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:32.859
Soo Jung only looks at Won Joon and goes straight to him.

165
00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:37.739
I think I love Won Joon.

166
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.440
I feel like he should meet a good woman.

167
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.009
Love...

168
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.450
is not when two good people meet.

169
00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:52.079
It's when two people who are in love come together.

170
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.790
Do you know how many scripts I wrote?

171
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:03.430
How many did you write?

172
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.629
You don't have time to talk about love.

173
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800
Yes, I do.

174
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.229
Love and work go together.

175
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.570
Though I'm still undergoing trial and error.

176
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.719
They aren't giving us anything extra.

177
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.150
I guess you have no influence here.

178
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:32.390
It's not that. They're busy.

179
00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.660
They didn't charge us last time.

180
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.660
Do you think that's easy? They did it because it was me.

181
00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.099
Let's just go.

182
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640
Excuse me, ma'am.

183
00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:50.839
You forgot to pay.

184
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.579
Don't you know who I am?

185
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.479
I do.

186
00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:58.479
But you're still acting like this?

187
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.520
Today's meal, the meal from the last time, and the wine.

188
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.589
It's 554 dollars in total.

189
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.660
(Total 554 dollars)

190
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.160
Won't you regret it?

191
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.900
I'm not sure what you mean.

192
00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:18.540
You'll find out soon enough.

193
00:13:32.849 --> 00:13:35.050
Let's not focus all our energy on casting a star.

194
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.520
Let's go with someone...

195
00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:38.759
who suits the character and wants the job.

196
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.690
After checking who is available,

197
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:42.560
I think that's how it'll be.

198
00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:45.959
Director Min got Seol Min Joo for Hong Ah.

199
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.430
Who told you?

200
00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:48.969
Hong Ah doesn't even know that.

201
00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:57.225
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E37 Temperature of Love "I Think I Love Him"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

202
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.420
I guess you tell everything to Kyung first.

203
00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:08.520
- It's not like that... - Keep it that way.

204
00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:10.719
Tell Kyung first.

205
00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:12.690
It's okay if I hear it from Kyung.

206
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.270
("High Society")

207
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:26.339
You're diligent. You wrote eight episodes.

208
00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:28.739
Stop marveling at my work,

209
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:30.479
and do your work.

210
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.879
Didn't you hear that I got Seol Min Joo?

211
00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:34.310
I told everyone.

212
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.780
I didn't.

213
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:38.420
Why am I the last person to know?

214
00:14:39.249 --> 00:14:40.920
This is frustrating.

215
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.719
Do you really have to nitpick over everything?

216
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.660
Are you puffing your chest because you got Seol Min Joo?

217
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.160
She said yes because of me, not because of your script.

218
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.530
You should thank me.

219
00:14:52.729 --> 00:14:55.070
All right. Thanks.

220
00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.770
Welcome.

221
00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.109
The script was great.

222
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.349
I want Min Joo to do Ms. Lee's drama.

223
00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:10.150
Mr. Kim, you have an eye.

224
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.079
Please sit down.

225
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.790
Why does Mr. Park want to see us?

226
00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:20.390
He wants to talk about casting. Didn't you hear?

227
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.599
I did, but Mr. Park and you have a special relationship.

228
00:15:25.329 --> 00:15:27.300
He doesn't listen to me anymore.

229
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.129
It was surprising that he did before.

230
00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.479
Gosh.

231
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.749
I have good news.

232
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.050
Seol Min Joo's boss came by just now.

233
00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:47.650
I had given him Kind Soup's script.

234
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:49.690
And?

235
00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:52.320
He said he'll do it.

236
00:15:52.859 --> 00:15:53.859
Really?

237
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.930
I heard she took Hong Ah's piece.

238
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.560
I heard that Yi Bok casted her.

239
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.410
What's going on, Mr. Park?

240
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.109
I heard from Seol Min Joo that she wants to work with me,

241
00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:13.609
but that her boss prefers Kind Soup.

242
00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:15.180
Are you trying to cut in line?

243
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.749
That's not what you said just before.

244
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:20.690
I'm risking everything on this. How can you steal my actress?

245
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.020
I don't know anything about this.

246
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.959
If you say you don't know, does it make it okay?

247
00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:29.089
Then did you steal Seol Min Joo so that she could succeed?

248
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.099
Mind your language, Hong Ah.

249
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.969
Let's get this straight...

250
00:16:33.969 --> 00:16:37.440
Director Min brought Seol Min Joo to work with me.

251
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.770
She didn't sign the contract yet,

252
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.109
and her boss wants her to do Kind Soup's script.

253
00:16:43.109 --> 00:16:46.180
It's Seol Min Joo. She wouldn't listen to her manager.

254
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.050
She's not as famous as she used to be.

255
00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:49.950
She failed many times.

256
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.820
She wouldn't be able to decide for herself.

257
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.989
That's what she said too.

258
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.489
Mr. Park, you can't do this. You need to support us.

259
00:16:57.489 --> 00:16:59.020
The actress wants this one.

260
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.459
Success comes when the actor does what they want to do.

261
00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.390
Not always.

262
00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:08.630
We weren't thinking of casting Seol Min Joo as Yeon Woo.

263
00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:12.039
She fits perfectly. Why weren't you?

264
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.969
Aren't you being too naive?

265
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.769
We decided to choose actors that fit well and act well...

266
00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:19.009
rather than those who are simply famous.

267
00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:22.850
That's a great choice. I know you always do what you want to do.

268
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.049
Her decision isn't the final decision.

269
00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:28.249
We all need to agree,

270
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.559
and I'll make the final decision.

271
00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:32.890
We want to focus on camera rather than casting.

272
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.229
We talked about that.

273
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.999
So,

274
00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:45.370
I've decided.

275
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.880
Director Min, well done.

276
00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:56.979
It's nice to be complimented.

277
00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:59.680
Hong Ah, let's make this work.

278
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.489
We're doing well enough. You're spoiling the fun.

279
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.860
I only meant well.

280
00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:09.130
You're so mean to me. I'm Min Yi Bok, you know.

281
00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:13.799
Director Min was so mean to you,

282
00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:15.769
yet he can't do anything in front of Hong Ah.

283
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.400
They don't look like a writer and a director, but a dog and his owner.

284
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.940
Yes. He's kind of cute when he's scared.

285
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.279
Was he always like that?

286
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.410
People's relationships are relative.

287
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.749
Look at her and me. Would I feel small elsewhere?

288
00:18:28.749 --> 00:18:31.080
- Yes. - You're the best.

289
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.690
Don't tease me.

290
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.420
Can't you two just decide whether or not you're dating?

291
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.059
It's killing me.

292
00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:40.360
- We're not dating. - We're dating.

293
00:18:41.489 --> 00:18:44.200
Gosh, when will this end?

294
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.269
Chef On Jung Sun sent them.

295
00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:13.019
It's a bit late, but congratulations on your 39th birthday.

296
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.860
On Jung Sun, who has warmth in his name.

297
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.700
(Lee Hyun Soo)

298
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.440
(Jung Sun)

299
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.080
Hello, Jung Sun.

300
00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:10.049
What are you doing right now?

301
00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:12.279
I'm working. I'm busy.

302
00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:15.049
I have to finish the casting by next week,

303
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:16.749
and then I have a script reading the week after next.

304
00:20:16.989 --> 00:20:19.459
- So we can't meet today? - No.

305
00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:23.630
I might have to stay overnight here. I might be here until the morning.

306
00:20:23.959 --> 00:20:25.930
- Did you eat? - Kind of.

307
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:29.830
You need to eat at least. You can't kind of eat.

308
00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:36.069
Jung Sun.

309
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:38.809
I came here to support you.

310
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.910
Welcome.

311
00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:44.380
But I only have about an hour.

312
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.950
That's more than enough.

313
00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:47.120
Let's go up.

314
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.420
What's your mom doing?

315
00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:54.259
She went home.

316
00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:56.930
It won't be easy for her to stay with me.

317
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.160
I think...

318
00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:02.729
your mom needs to get comfortable in order for you to relax.

319
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.440
We need to live with your mom for the rest of our life.

320
00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:10.779
"We"?

321
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.580
Yes, "we".

322
00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:18.019
After hanging out with your mom,

323
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.219
I realized that she's fashionable and has good taste.

324
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.019
She's good at making things.

325
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.160
She can cook, arrange flowers, and make clothes.

326
00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:28.930
Arranging flowers seem most likely out of those three.

327
00:21:29.229 --> 00:21:30.259
For what?

328
00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:33.930
I think she should do it for a living. It's a waste of talent.

329
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.469
But...

330
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.299
it's hard for people to change.

331
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.239
That's what happened to us too.

332
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.340
We met after missing each other for a long time,

333
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.009
but we had to go separate ways for a while.

334
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.249
But it didn't take long for us to come back to each other.

335
00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.319
She can do it too.

336
00:21:56.749 --> 00:21:57.819
Eat first.

337
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.690
You don't want to hear this.

338
00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:02.360
By the way, your mother is coming to Good Soup tomorrow.

339
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.729
I heard. I'll take her.

340
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.729
Eat this one.

341
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.670
- Is it delicious? - Yes.

342
00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:31.420
Why are you mimicking me?

343
00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:34.190
I'm doing what I want to do.

344
00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:39.529
Why do you like me?

345
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.870
You said I wear glasses, and that I'm not your type.

346
00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:47.840
I don't know.

347
00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:50.640
Why don't you?

348
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.140
I know.

349
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.049
How can you know this if I don't know?

350
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.549
It's because I'm so pretty.

351
00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:02.690
Don't do that. You're not pretty.

352
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:06.219
I want people to like me for that reason.

353
00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:08.430
It's the least calculative...

354
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.729
to like someone for their looks.

355
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.130
Do you want unconditional love?

356
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.269
You're like a baby, aren't you?

357
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.340
What are you talking about?

358
00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:24.580
I've been married and divorced.

359
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.779
That means...

360
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:29.950
that I've tried.

361
00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:34.049
I tried to love even though it hurt me.

362
00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:39.120
But you only want light relationships.

363
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.759
Are you going to eat sweets for the rest of your life?

364
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.229
But I don't want to date you.

365
00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:19.200
All right.

366
00:24:21.069 --> 00:24:22.670
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

367
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.299
That's a strange way of asking someone out.

368
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.110
All right.

369
00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:31.940
We can have a fling and eat dinner, but we won't date.

370
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.110
What do you want to eat?

371
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.519
Pork rib hangover soup.

372
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.150
All right.

373
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.860
Were you surprised that I wanted to see you?

374
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.499
Yes, I wasn't expecting this.

375
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:59.499
How is Won Joon?

376
00:25:00.309 --> 00:25:01.969
Why do you ask me?

377
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.080
You should contact him yourself.

378
00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:07.749
You should be nice to him.

379
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.180
He suffered a lot when he liked me.

380
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.019
From now on, I won't bother him.

381
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.059
You don't have to worry about me.

382
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:24.700
We're not...

383
00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:27.769
in a relationship anymore.

384
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.610
When he received the call that you were in an accident,

385
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.670
he ran out in a hurry.

386
00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:40.749
If he gave it some thought,

387
00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:45.279
he would've been able to tell if you were lying or not.

388
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.989
What's that supposed to mean?

389
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.259
He ran over to you...

390
00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:52.660
because of that 0.1 percent possibility that you got injured,

391
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.890
regardless of whether it was a lie or not.

392
00:25:57.529 --> 00:26:00.130
Everyone has a past relationship that they get reminded of sometimes.

393
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.430
But if you run over to that person, that means it's still ongoing.

394
00:26:18.749 --> 00:26:19.819
Won Joon.

395
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.450
Hey.

396
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.430
Are you still angry at me?

397
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.989
No. I'm fine since you didn't get hurt.

398
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.870
Do you want to drink tea?

399
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.870
No, I want to go home and rest.

400
00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:39.400
Even when I'm asking you to?

401
00:26:39.969 --> 00:26:40.969
I'm tired.

402
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.140
We're here.

403
00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:18.979
It looks delicious.

404
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.809
I should go say hello.

405
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.319
Congratulations on getting a Michelin star.

406
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.620
Thank you.

407
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.959
You always cooked food for me.

408
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.999
I'd like to invite you over to our place next time.

409
00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:41.499
This is a gift from my mom.

410
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.870
I got you gloves and hand cream.

411
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.209
You're always using your hands, so you should take care of them.

412
00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:52.610
You got me just what I needed.

413
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.850
Mother, you're here.

414
00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:00.950
I didn't know you were here.

415
00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.150
These flowers are so pretty.

416
00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:06.019
I'm thinking about showing off my skills.

417
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.759
It might help me refresh myself.

418
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:10.090
Mom.

419
00:28:10.459 --> 00:28:11.459
Yes, Jung Sun.

420
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:13.360
Hyun Soo's mother's here.

421
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.299
I know. I can see that.

422
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.640
Hello.

423
00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.340
I heard you were sick.

424
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.580
You look great now.

425
00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:27.309
Thank you.

426
00:28:28.049 --> 00:28:31.979
I owe Chef On a lot. He was very kind to me when I was hospitalized.

427
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.019
I only did what I could. You don't owe me anything.

428
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.600
Please give me a cup of tea too.

429
00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:57.739
Why are you pretending to help out by following me inside?

430
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.309
Was I being too obvious?

431
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.709
It's unfair that I have to be the one stuck between those two.

432
00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:04.549
Let's go together.

433
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.880
Okay.

434
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:12.289
I see that you didn't bring your husband with you today.

435
00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:13.959
He had to go to work.

436
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.299
He used up all his annual leaves to take care of me.

437
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.100
I heard some people say that...

438
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.870
it's more comfortable to hire a caregiver.

439
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.969
That must not be the case for you.

440
00:29:26.239 --> 00:29:29.569
My husband and I are best friends.

441
00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:31.340
I feel most comfortable when I'm with him.

442
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.850
Why didn't you come with your fiance today?

443
00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:40.950
That fiance flew away.

444
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:43.190
What does that mean?

445
00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:46.759
Birds tend to fly.

446
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:53.160
But a fiance isn't a bird. It's a man you promise to get married to.

447
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.769
That's just the literal translation.

448
00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:58.940
After living a life that was full of ups and downs,

449
00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:00.539
I've concluded that...

450
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.709
it's normal...

451
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.309
for birds to fly,

452
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:07.910
so I shouldn't try to stop them when they do.

453
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.580
I see. You're very philosophical.

454
00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:14.019
I understand what you mean.

455
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.590
I'm glad you understand.

456
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.660
It wasn't that hard.

457
00:30:24.959 --> 00:30:28.569
Chef On seems very gentle and warm.

458
00:30:29.229 --> 00:30:31.100
I hear that I'm gentle a lot.

459
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.870
Who does Hyun Soo take after? She has a great personality.

460
00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:38.239
She takes after me of course.

461
00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:39.709
I see.

462
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.779
Hyun Soo likes Jung Sun a lot.

463
00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:46.890
I know. She even asked him to live together first.

464
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.319
She did?

465
00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:50.959
I didn't know that.

466
00:30:51.819 --> 00:30:53.019
Didn't you know?

467
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:55.330
I thought you knew.

468
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.459
Then why aren't they living together?

469
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.670
Chef On must be preparing something else along with the tea.

470
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.709
Here's your delicious tea.

471
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.350
Please tell me if you'd like to eat anything else.

472
00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.049
No, I'm fine.

473
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.450
He's such a caring person.

474
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:23.890
He's the best husband material there is.

475
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.059
Jung Sun's father is a dentist.

476
00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:31.959
I see.

477
00:31:32.999 --> 00:31:34.670
That's a great job.

478
00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.866
(Episode 38 will air shortly.)
