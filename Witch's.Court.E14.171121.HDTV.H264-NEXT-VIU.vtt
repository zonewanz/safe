1
00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:14.026
Case number 2017LO309 for murder.

2
00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:16.337
We will now begin the appeal trial.

3
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.596
The prosecutor is present.

4
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.436
Defendant Ahn Tae Kyoo...

5
00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.166
and his counsel are present.

6
00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:23.906
Defendant Baek Min Ho...

7
00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:26.046
and his public defender are present.

8
00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.476
We'll hear from the prosecution first.

9
00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:30.846
What are your grounds for appeal?

10
00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:38.086
The defendant insisted...

11
00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:41.156
that Baek Min Ho murdered Kong Soo Ah,

12
00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:42.427
and submitted a glove...

13
00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:45.226
with Baek Min Ho's blood as evidence.

14
00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:46.927
Jung Young Ho of NFS, who analyzed the blood,

15
00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:49.336
submitted this written statement.

16
00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:55.906
He states...

17
00:00:56.277 --> 00:00:58.376
that no such evidence existed...

18
00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:00.406
and that he forged it...

19
00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:01.777
per Ahn Tae Kyoo's request.

20
00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.846
It proves he concealed his own crime...

21
00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.686
and that he was...

22
00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:11.617
the real murderer.

23
00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:14.387
Defense. Do you have anything to say?

24
00:01:15.527 --> 00:01:16.896
I'd like to submit...

25
00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.997
Lee Sang Joon's letter of resignation from NFS.

26
00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:23.566
Why are you submitting this?

27
00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:25.936
He was the NFS technician...

28
00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:27.807
who analyzed the glove...

29
00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:30.206
the prosecution submitted into evidence.

30
00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.876
He was fired...

31
00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:33.406
for embezzlement.

32
00:01:34.247 --> 00:01:37.346
If we accept the assertion that the glove evidence...

33
00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:39.617
was forged as per Ahn Tae Kyoo's orders,

34
00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:42.486
we must also question...

35
00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:45.887
the glove the prosecution submitted.

36
00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:49.296
Both pieces of evidence the parties submitted...

37
00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:51.827
lack credibility, and thus,

38
00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.766
we will exclude both from consideration.

39
00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:57.436
Prosecution.

40
00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.236
Do you have any other evidence?

41
00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:04.977
The trial is over.

42
00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:06.676
Let's go.

43
00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:31.366
Your Honor.

44
00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.236
I'm the defendant Baek Min Ho's new counsel.

45
00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:36.407
Ma Yi Deum.

46
00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:47.187
(Power of Attorney)

47
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.896
The one who murdered Kong Soo Ah...

48
00:02:56.757 --> 00:02:57.757
is...

49
00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:04.597
Ahn Tae Kyoo.

50
00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.276
Counsel.

51
00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:11.107
Do you have proof?

52
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.646
I submit...

53
00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:17.877
a video of Ahn Tae Kyoo assaulting the victim...

54
00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:19.387
on the day of the murder into evidence.

55
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.857
Ahn Tae Kyoo...

56
00:03:58.216 --> 00:04:00.287
concealed his crime...

57
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.257
and framed his friend Baek Min Ho for it all.

58
00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:06.426
He has not repented at all this entire time.

59
00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:08.067
He manipulated evidence,

60
00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:09.496
covered up his crime,

61
00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:12.296
and manipulated the law. Thus, I recommend...

62
00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:15.567
he be sent to life in prison.

63
00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:17.937
We overrule the decision...

64
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:19.206
in the initial trial...

65
00:04:19.247 --> 00:04:21.906
against Ahn Tae Kyoo and Baek Min Ho.

66
00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:24.577
Ahn Tae Kyoo is sentenced to life in prison,

67
00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:25.846
and Baek Min Ho...

68
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.987
is sentenced to three years in prison.

69
00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:31.416
Baek Min Ho's sentence will be reduced, however,

70
00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.557
to five years of probation.

71
00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.497
Let go. Let go of me!

72
00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:40.666
Let go!

73
00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.327
Let go!

74
00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:44.637
Let go!

75
00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:46.507
Let go!

76
00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:05.786
Hand it in today.

77
00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:11.226
Are you all right?

78
00:05:11.557 --> 00:05:13.666
- Get Gap Soo on the line. - Okay.

79
00:05:26.047 --> 00:05:28.547
- Did the trial go well? - You knew, didn't you?

80
00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:31.516
- Pardon? - The video...

81
00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:33.387
from Kingdom.

82
00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.656
What do you mean?

83
00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:39.987
They just showed a video...

84
00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:42.456
of Tae Kyoo at Kingdom.

85
00:05:43.757 --> 00:05:46.396
- How would that get... - Because of it,

86
00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:51.067
Tae Kyoo got lifetime in prison.

87
00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:53.666
What will you do now?

88
00:05:55.737 --> 00:05:56.836
Listen.

89
00:05:57.177 --> 00:06:00.976
I'll look into it then get back to you.

90
00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:14.887
(Two days ago)

91
00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:22.697
We can get Tae Kyoo with this.

92
00:06:22.997 --> 00:06:24.036
Yes.

93
00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.166
The problem is getting Cho Gap Soo.

94
00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:29.276
Once he finds out about the Kingdom video,

95
00:06:29.476 --> 00:06:33.007
he'll try to cover it no matter what.

96
00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:36.016
We have to win the trial and expose Kingdom too.

97
00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:37.646
We should use media to our advantage.

98
00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:40.187
You must know already,

99
00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:42.416
but Cho has a hand in the industry too.

100
00:06:44.257 --> 00:06:46.956
It doesn't have to be through a news, right?

101
00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:50.956
I know just the person.

102
00:06:51.827 --> 00:06:54.327
(Han Jung Mi)

103
00:06:56.766 --> 00:07:00.007
I run internet shows after leaving JoongA Ilbo.

104
00:07:02.437 --> 00:07:03.536
You can trust me.

105
00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:05.906
I'll give proper exposure...

106
00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:07.877
for Cho Gap Soo and Kingdom.

107
00:07:10.776 --> 00:07:11.916
What is it?

108
00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:14.346
Sir, you need to take a look at this.

109
00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:23.827
There is an internet show about your nephew.

110
00:07:24.297 --> 00:07:27.567
Today at this court, the truth...

111
00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:29.197
about the Kong Soo Ah case was revealed.

112
00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.466
Unlike what was revealed in the first trial,

113
00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:36.206
the true murderer of the case was Ahn Tae Kyoo.

114
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:37.606
Ahn Tae Kyoo,

115
00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:39.206
a law school student at Hankuk University...

116
00:07:39.247 --> 00:07:42.406
is the son of Hyungjae's Chairman Ahn Suk Pil.

117
00:07:43.447 --> 00:07:45.887
The truth was concealed until now...

118
00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:49.117
because Hyungjae Hotel hid the fact...

119
00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:52.557
Ahn murdered in order to keep their honor.

120
00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:56.327
However, that wasn't the only reason.

121
00:07:57.057 --> 00:07:59.127
A lobbying room exists in Hyungjae Hotel,

122
00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:02.697
but it was kept a secret to the public.

123
00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.007
That's where the murder happened.

124
00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:09.776
According to a report, the prime minister...

125
00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:12.846
among many other high officials...

126
00:08:12.906 --> 00:08:15.547
have frequented Hyungjae Hotel.

127
00:08:16.047 --> 00:08:19.286
Kingdom is on the K level of Hyungjae Hotel.

128
00:08:19.286 --> 00:08:21.286
It's a VIP membership club.

129
00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:25.257
I saw a lot of high officials there.

130
00:08:25.656 --> 00:08:29.327
They drink expensive alcohol with young women.

131
00:08:29.497 --> 00:08:32.567
The prime minister recently asked...

132
00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:34.996
the chancellor of Hankuk University...

133
00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:36.567
to get his grandson enrolled.

134
00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:39.466
I think this happened many times before.

135
00:08:39.807 --> 00:08:42.476
From what I hear, Ahn Tae Kyoo...

136
00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:44.136
also got into their law school...

137
00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:45.736
after building the school auditorium.

138
00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:47.246
After checking,

139
00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:48.647
Ahn Tae Kyoo attended...

140
00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:50.917
only 14 days of class this year.

141
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:54.447
However, his average was A,

142
00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:56.417
and he even received a scholarship.

143
00:08:56.616 --> 00:08:58.317
This is something...

144
00:08:58.386 --> 00:09:00.986
that cannot be explained without lobbying.

145
00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:04.527
We witnessed a murderer who advanced in society...

146
00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:08.027
due to lobbying frame someone else.

147
00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:11.897
With this video, we will not stay silent.

148
00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:15.136
They concealed the death of an innocent woman,

149
00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:17.537
and lobbied for Illicit admissions.

150
00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:19.947
This is where various lobbying...

151
00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:22.077
with high officials took place.

152
00:09:22.447 --> 00:09:23.447
We highly urge...

153
00:09:23.447 --> 00:09:25.216
a special investigation of Kingdom.

154
00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:05.386
Baek Min Ho, out.

155
00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:11.527
Min Ho, why are you leaving?

156
00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.267
That outfit suits you the most.

157
00:10:16.897 --> 00:10:18.037
What?

158
00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:23.236
You jerk! Where are you going?

159
00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:25.907
Baek Min Ho! Baek Min Ho!

160
00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:28.777
Come back, you jerk!

161
00:11:05.177 --> 00:11:07.417
(Real Estate Register)

162
00:11:39.077 --> 00:11:40.216
Baek Min Ho.

163
00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:50.496
Anyway, thank you for your work.

164
00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:52.827
I didn't come to get your thank you.

165
00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:55.366
There is something your brother owes me.

166
00:11:59.807 --> 00:12:01.636
If something happens to me,

167
00:12:02.307 --> 00:12:04.677
I'll leave the evidence with my brother.

168
00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:07.706
Why would he send you such a text?

169
00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:10.277
He did something extremely wrong to me.

170
00:12:11.246 --> 00:12:13.447
He died while trying to fix it.

171
00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:17.356
Did he say anything about this?

172
00:12:20.187 --> 00:12:21.327
No.

173
00:12:23.456 --> 00:12:26.327
Anyway, I got you out...

174
00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:28.726
because of the evidence he promised me.

175
00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:33.067
I don't have much time. Call me when you find it.

176
00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:36.736
All right.

177
00:12:38.537 --> 00:12:40.777
The place of Kong Soo Ah's murder...

178
00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:43.216
took place in Hyungjae Hotel's Kingdom.

179
00:12:43.317 --> 00:12:46.586
The news of the lobbying and illicit admissions...

180
00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:50.517
allowed Kingdom to become a hot topic to research.

181
00:12:50.886 --> 00:12:53.287
On the Blue House's website,

182
00:12:53.386 --> 00:12:55.386
over 10,000 citizens requested...

183
00:12:55.386 --> 00:12:57.356
the special investigation of Kingdom.

184
00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:03.067
It's going per your plan.

185
00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:07.407
You're behind this, aren't you?

186
00:13:10.777 --> 00:13:12.037
It took me 20 years.

187
00:13:12.407 --> 00:13:14.047
You're amazing.

188
00:13:14.447 --> 00:13:18.376
You were always like this when we were in training.

189
00:13:19.687 --> 00:13:22.557
And you were known to keep your promises.

190
00:13:27.486 --> 00:13:30.057
You haven't forgotten your promise...

191
00:13:30.427 --> 00:13:31.657
to help me catch Cho Gap Soo, right?

192
00:13:32.427 --> 00:13:33.626
Of course not.

193
00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:36.836
However, you have to wait.

194
00:13:37.897 --> 00:13:39.807
The district attorney is against it.

195
00:13:40.037 --> 00:13:43.077
We can't investigate just based on public opinion.

196
00:13:43.376 --> 00:13:46.777
That's why I need you to help me find evidence.

197
00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:49.177
We have to get it all out of him...

198
00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:51.017
before he makes a move.

199
00:13:53.787 --> 00:13:56.557
I'm asking you. What's between you and Ma?

200
00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.226
Are you still on that?

201
00:13:59.657 --> 00:14:03.496
You found that video. Did you give it to her?

202
00:14:04.496 --> 00:14:05.626
What is this about?

203
00:14:05.797 --> 00:14:08.327
My instinct tells me you two are...

204
00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:10.037
not dating.

205
00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:12.297
Have this.

206
00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:16.236
You give her a video, and I get a pickle?

207
00:14:16.836 --> 00:14:19.506
I'm your senior. Don't keep me out of it.

208
00:14:19.746 --> 00:14:22.777
You should share if there's something good.

209
00:14:24.517 --> 00:14:27.386
Gosh, you're so cheap.

210
00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:29.856
You pay for the noodles.

211
00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:35.226
Did you eat, sir?

212
00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:36.856
Yes.

213
00:14:39.697 --> 00:14:42.437
- You must be Yeo. - Yes.

214
00:14:44.037 --> 00:14:46.067
I heard about you from Ms. Min.

215
00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:11.996
What is this about?

216
00:15:11.996 --> 00:15:13.197
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

217
00:15:13.197 --> 00:15:14.567
I'm from the Prosecutors' Office.

218
00:15:14.567 --> 00:15:16.236
From now on, we'll start our search...

219
00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:17.897
and seizure of Kingdom.

220
00:15:26.876 --> 00:15:28.006
Don't follow us.

221
00:15:28.346 --> 00:15:29.547
We'll take care of it.

222
00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:33.216
Those guys.

223
00:15:33.647 --> 00:15:35.187
Why didn't they cooperate before?

224
00:15:40.486 --> 00:15:42.797
Excuse me, which level is Kingdom?

225
00:15:43.027 --> 00:15:44.197
I wouldn't know.

226
00:15:48.626 --> 00:15:49.736
They don't know.

227
00:15:52.767 --> 00:15:54.407
I'll call someone.

228
00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:01.476
You forgot this.

229
00:16:02.716 --> 00:16:05.147
You can't go up to Kingdom without this.

230
00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:57.096
The prosecutors left empty-handed.

231
00:16:57.096 --> 00:16:58.167
Okay.

232
00:17:08.707 --> 00:17:11.176
(Oh Soo Chul: Get ready for a search.)

233
00:17:13.247 --> 00:17:15.217
It's too late with Tae Kyoo.

234
00:17:16.017 --> 00:17:17.356
Everyone with eyes...

235
00:17:17.356 --> 00:17:19.926
are dying to see Kingdom.

236
00:17:20.356 --> 00:17:22.386
I'm going to make it public.

237
00:17:22.856 --> 00:17:24.527
You're responsible too.

238
00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:27.196
Gosh.

239
00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:28.997
You should be cool-headed...

240
00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:30.936
at a time like this.

241
00:17:30.997 --> 00:17:32.096
What did you say?

242
00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:34.537
Kingdom is my secret room,

243
00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:37.606
but this is your hotel.

244
00:17:38.106 --> 00:17:41.606
- So? - You need to cover us up.

245
00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:45.376
Kingdom isn't located in Yeongpa City Hall.

246
00:17:45.646 --> 00:17:46.787
It's right here.

247
00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:50.186
Inside your hotel.

248
00:17:51.856 --> 00:17:53.257
On top of that,

249
00:17:54.027 --> 00:17:56.126
you got to collect some dough...

250
00:17:56.126 --> 00:17:57.926
from high officials...

251
00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:00.067
with your talk about White Town.

252
00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:02.866
If the prosecution goes deeper,

253
00:18:02.866 --> 00:18:04.836
you'll be responsible for lobbying too.

254
00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:06.906
How will you...

255
00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:08.836
fix that?

256
00:18:10.707 --> 00:18:12.136
Gap Soo.

257
00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:13.807
You...

258
00:18:13.807 --> 00:18:15.606
It's only a passing storm.

259
00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:18.217
Just erase everything and stay quiet.

260
00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:20.086
It'll be gone before we know it.

261
00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:23.616
If you want to reduce Tae Kyoo's sentence,

262
00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:28.586
you need to be alive and well.

263
00:18:46.106 --> 00:18:47.207
Did you look into it?

264
00:18:47.807 --> 00:18:48.807
Yes.

265
00:18:53.346 --> 00:18:54.817
Who's supporting...

266
00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:57.186
the prosecution's side?

267
00:18:57.356 --> 00:18:58.987
Assistant prosecutor general, Song.

268
00:18:59.086 --> 00:19:01.827
He was in training with Min Ji Sook.

269
00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:05.866
It's Min Ji Sook again?

270
00:19:06.096 --> 00:19:07.467
Because of the illicit admissions,

271
00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:09.166
the public is making complaints.

272
00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:10.396
Even at the Prosecutors' Office,

273
00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:12.936
many are supporting a special investigation.

274
00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:16.676
We better calm down the Prosecutors' Office.

275
00:19:17.636 --> 00:19:20.376
Book a time with the district attorney.

276
00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.077
Yes, sir.

277
00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:24.916
Also,

278
00:19:25.116 --> 00:19:28.116
Chancellor Kim Ho Kyung keeps on calling you.

279
00:19:28.287 --> 00:19:29.317
He received a notice to visit...

280
00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:31.586
the Prosecutors' Office for illicit admissions.

281
00:19:31.586 --> 00:19:33.626
Tell him to figure it out himself!

282
00:19:34.227 --> 00:19:36.757
I don't have time to take care of him.

283
00:19:37.827 --> 00:19:39.027
All right.

284
00:20:07.626 --> 00:20:08.626
(Baek Sang Ho)

285
00:20:14.067 --> 00:20:16.836
Sang Ho, I'm sorry.

286
00:20:56.507 --> 00:20:57.507
Sang Ho,

287
00:20:57.977 --> 00:20:59.906
this house is so cool.

288
00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:02.846
When I grow up and make a lot of money,

289
00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.277
I'll buy this house.

290
00:21:05.017 --> 00:21:07.047
Then you and I can live here forever.

291
00:21:07.287 --> 00:21:08.317
Okay?

292
00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:09.457
Okay.

293
00:21:09.557 --> 00:21:11.717
We'll live here for a long time.

294
00:21:29.936 --> 00:21:31.906
Where did he leave it?

295
00:21:40.317 --> 00:21:41.317
Do you remember?

296
00:21:41.747 --> 00:21:43.156
When you were in elementary school,

297
00:21:44.057 --> 00:21:45.416
there was a house...

298
00:21:45.586 --> 00:21:48.257
with a big tree that you admired.

299
00:22:59.126 --> 00:23:01.297
(Business trip with Congressman Cho Gap Soo)

300
00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.737
(I'm seeing Cho for the Kingdom video.)

301
00:23:02.737 --> 00:23:04.166
(I hope this won't be my last.)

302
00:23:10.977 --> 00:23:12.577
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

303
00:23:19.686 --> 00:23:21.386
Yes. Welcome.

304
00:23:22.987 --> 00:23:25.856
You've been busy lately, right?

305
00:23:27.686 --> 00:23:29.327
You must be busy too.

306
00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:38.067
Hey, do you remember...

307
00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:41.106
Mr. Park who retired last year?

308
00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:44.307
He had two law firms...

309
00:23:44.836 --> 00:23:46.346
merge recently.

310
00:23:46.346 --> 00:23:47.977
He's looking for new lawyers.

311
00:23:49.676 --> 00:23:50.676
Would you...

312
00:23:51.146 --> 00:23:52.277
be interested?

313
00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:55.586
I don't intend on quitting yet.

314
00:23:58.487 --> 00:23:59.487
Is that so?

315
00:24:01.827 --> 00:24:03.156
I must have got it wrong.

316
00:24:03.827 --> 00:24:05.997
I hear that you're...

317
00:24:06.366 --> 00:24:08.497
interested in special prosecutions.

318
00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:13.037
I hear that you and Min Ji Sook...

319
00:24:13.037 --> 00:24:14.967
had a secret meeting.

320
00:24:15.836 --> 00:24:18.307
Everyone's talking about it.

321
00:24:19.146 --> 00:24:21.207
Let me tell you a rumor too.

322
00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:23.146
I heard that some of us...

323
00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:25.846
are involved with Kingdom's corruption.

324
00:24:25.846 --> 00:24:27.717
Have you heard about it?

325
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.757
I worked 30 years for the Prosecutors' Office.

326
00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:41.027
I've witnessed many prosecutors get ruined...

327
00:24:41.027 --> 00:24:43.067
while chasing rumors of the public.

328
00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:45.666
Do you know what they had in common?

329
00:24:46.807 --> 00:24:48.007
They blabbed...

330
00:24:48.836 --> 00:24:51.277
about justice and conviction,

331
00:24:51.676 --> 00:24:53.906
and what they wanted was success.

332
00:24:56.217 --> 00:24:57.817
I don't want immature kids like that,

333
00:24:58.116 --> 00:24:59.916
but prosecutors who take responsibility...

334
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:01.317
for their actions.

335
00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:05.356
Especially if they're working under me.

336
00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:09.126
Do you mean the search and seizure of Kingdom?

337
00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:12.327
The entire nation is watching,

338
00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:15.227
and you showed them how you failed.

339
00:25:16.436 --> 00:25:19.767
Shouldn't you take responsibility for that?

340
00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:21.406
Don't you agree?

341
00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:24.077
Of course.

342
00:25:24.077 --> 00:25:27.946
Someone needs to be accountable.

343
00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.457
Sir.

344
00:25:46.096 --> 00:25:49.196
I think we were too rash.

345
00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:52.807
I said I'd take responsibility...

346
00:25:53.007 --> 00:25:54.936
for going in to search without following rules.

347
00:25:55.037 --> 00:25:56.537
I'll do it, sir.

348
00:25:58.037 --> 00:26:00.446
If someone must be accountable at this stage,

349
00:26:00.646 --> 00:26:02.777
it should be me, since I am weak.

350
00:26:03.477 --> 00:26:07.386
You have more things to do as a prosecutor.

351
00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:14.787
Three months of suspension?

352
00:26:18.126 --> 00:26:20.827
Yeo. What's gotten into you lately?

353
00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:24.467
You conduct a search without notifying me,

354
00:26:24.737 --> 00:26:27.636
you notify me that you've been suspended...

355
00:26:27.707 --> 00:26:29.106
I'm sorry, ma'am.

356
00:26:36.547 --> 00:26:37.646
Ma'am.

357
00:26:38.547 --> 00:26:39.916
I need to talk to you.

358
00:26:40.217 --> 00:26:42.886
What have you been doing?

359
00:26:43.116 --> 00:26:44.557
You'll get hurt if you find out.

360
00:26:44.787 --> 00:26:46.827
- Are you doing... - Ms. Ma.

361
00:26:46.886 --> 00:26:48.356
It's been so long.

362
00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:49.856
It really has.

363
00:26:49.856 --> 00:26:53.166
Ms. Ma. You've gotten prettier since you left.

364
00:26:53.426 --> 00:26:54.967
You must like being a lawyer.

365
00:26:55.126 --> 00:26:57.936
Seo. You're good at backhanded compliments.

366
00:26:57.936 --> 00:26:59.267
You're a pro.

367
00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:01.507
Anyway, it's good to see you.

368
00:27:01.567 --> 00:27:03.777
I had many questions for you.

369
00:27:03.876 --> 00:27:06.777
What have you and Yeo been doing?

370
00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:09.376
Why are you asking me about him?

371
00:27:09.547 --> 00:27:11.547
He's your junior prosecutor now.

372
00:27:12.247 --> 00:27:14.886
Exactly. I'm his senior prosecutor,

373
00:27:14.886 --> 00:27:16.987
but he won't talk to me.

374
00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:22.057
Anyway, it's so nice seeing you here.

375
00:27:22.186 --> 00:27:25.696
I know. You're a perfect fit with CAGU.

376
00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:28.027
Why are you going around...

377
00:27:29.196 --> 00:27:32.767
Anyway, can't CAGU expand or something,

378
00:27:32.767 --> 00:27:34.606
so that Ms. Ma will have a spot?

379
00:27:35.807 --> 00:27:37.207
Right, Mr. Yeo?

380
00:27:37.676 --> 00:27:40.106
It would be nice if we had an opening.

381
00:27:40.346 --> 00:27:41.376
Stop that.

382
00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:47.047
It's not like you were fired.

383
00:27:47.317 --> 00:27:49.047
It's just a three-month suspension.

384
00:27:49.047 --> 00:27:50.757
Isn't the box a bit much?

385
00:27:50.787 --> 00:27:52.457
They aren't my personal effects.

386
00:27:52.827 --> 00:27:56.096
They're documents for the case.

387
00:27:57.096 --> 00:27:59.626
Why does a suspended prosecutor need that?

388
00:27:59.797 --> 00:28:00.967
Why else?

389
00:28:01.567 --> 00:28:03.136
Aren't you going to catch Cho Gap Soo?

390
00:28:04.196 --> 00:28:05.836
I told you last time,

391
00:28:06.307 --> 00:28:08.807
that I'll punish everyone who did that...

392
00:28:09.537 --> 00:28:12.747
to your mother, regardless of who they are.

393
00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:16.846
You can't be persuaded. What can I do?

394
00:28:17.676 --> 00:28:20.287
You insist on walking down a thorny path.

395
00:28:21.386 --> 00:28:23.217
You sound like this has nothing to do with you.

396
00:28:23.787 --> 00:28:25.116
Admit it now.

397
00:28:25.557 --> 00:28:27.156
We're already in the same boat.

Well... I was... I was just thinking.

Sure. Okay. It's urgent, so come.

Yes, ma'am. Now? Yes, ma'am.

Please find this person.

405
00:29:19.606 --> 00:29:21.247
It's for sex trafficking?

406
00:29:21.477 --> 00:29:23.317
Must we arrest him?

407
00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:25.517
Yes. The sooner the better.

408
00:29:25.886 --> 00:29:28.787
He's on the run, so work with the police.

409
00:29:28.846 --> 00:29:29.916
Understood.

410
00:29:30.987 --> 00:29:32.217
Sleep at home.

411
00:29:33.757 --> 00:29:36.126

(Police Fail in Searching Hyungjae Hotel)

413
00:29:41.767 --> 00:29:44.636
The police searched Hyungjae Hotel's Kingdom,

414
00:29:44.636 --> 00:29:46.636
in relation to lobbying conducted there...

415

regarding admissions into Hankuk University.

416
00:29:50.207 --> 00:29:53.346
Hyungjae Hotel asserts they suffered a loss...

417
00:29:53.477 --> 00:29:55.507
due to the police's unreasonable search.

418
00:29:55.577 --> 00:29:57.916
They state they will file a complaint...

Doctor, we'll start the shoot now.

423
00:30:27.207 --> 00:30:29.446
- Okay. - Also,

- Bujin? - Yes.

427
00:30:38.217 --> 00:30:40.727
There's a long term care facility named Naeil,

428
00:30:40.856 --> 00:30:42.856
and it is a happy and energetic place.

429
00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:45.126
Okay. I understand.

430
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:47.896
It's as you said.

431
00:30:48.196 --> 00:30:50.737
We stopped Ahn Suh Rim's medication,

432

and she is regaining consciousness.

433
00:30:57.237 --> 00:30:59.277
Okay. I understand.

Who was that?

435
00:31:04.146 --> 00:31:06.287
Insurance to get Cho Gap Soo.

436
00:31:09.957 --> 00:31:11.317
What insurance?

437
00:31:12.217 --> 00:31:13.487
Just something.

438
00:31:14.126 --> 00:31:16.757
Can't you share your Intel, please?

439
00:31:18.027 --> 00:31:19.267
Why should I?

440
00:31:33.106 --> 00:31:34.507
What are you doing?

441
00:31:34.747 --> 00:31:36.446
If you won't share your Intel,

442
00:31:36.446 --> 00:31:38.146
I won't share my car.

Oh, my gosh.

Is this all the evidence your brother mentioned?

00:32:38.237 --> 00:32:39.376
First,

454
00:32:40.047 --> 00:32:41.446
why don't you read it?

455
00:32:45.346 --> 00:32:47.686
I'm heading to see Cho Gap Soo...

456
00:32:47.686 --> 00:32:50.156
to get the video of Ahn Tae Kyoo beating...

I hope this will not be my last.

This looks like his last entry.

460
00:32:58.797 --> 00:32:59.866
That's right.

461
00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:03.096
The evidence he mentioned was his journal.

462
00:33:03.396 --> 00:33:05.366
- His journal? - That's right.

463

for the past 20 years.

465
00:33:10.676 --> 00:33:13.106
They're all written there in great detail.

466
00:33:13.977 --> 00:33:16.247
With that journal, you can get Cho Gap Soo...

467
00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:19.487
and lock him up for life.

478

Find proof that my brother was murdered.

00:34:01.757 --> 00:34:03.727

to do anything for the time being.

493
00:36:12.526 --> 00:36:14.756
I didn't expect him to play so dirty.

494
00:36:15.557 --> 00:36:17.256
He caught us off guard.

495
00:36:17.426 --> 00:36:18.897
Can we get the special investigation?

496
00:36:22.837 --> 00:36:26.366
The prosecutors' office seems against it.

497
00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:28.607
The media is quieting down as well.

498
00:36:28.837 --> 00:36:30.337
It'll be difficult in our current state.

499
00:36:31.807 --> 00:36:34.477
This calls for a fatal blow.

500

Something necessitating a special investigation.

502
00:36:40.846 --> 00:36:42.247
That's what we need.

503
00:36:43.057 --> 00:36:45.486
We need Baek Sang Ho's journal then.

504
00:36:45.656 --> 00:36:48.156
We need to resolve his death first.

505
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:49.997
But the case was closed...

506
00:36:49.997 --> 00:36:51.756
as a suicide three years ago,

507
00:36:52.057 --> 00:36:54.466
and there probably isn't any useful evidence left.

508
00:36:56.136 --> 00:36:57.236
Can you do it?

509
00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:59.636
If there aren't any, we'll have to create one.

510
00:37:00.037 --> 00:37:02.977
The journal is the only way to Cho Gap Soo.

511
00:37:06.647 --> 00:37:09.216
I collected documents regarding his death.

512

Let's share that first.

513

- Okay. - I'll leave that to you.

514
00:37:15.417 --> 00:37:18.017
I'll look to see if I can find anything.

515
00:37:18.287 --> 00:37:19.386
See you later.

516
00:37:29.937 --> 00:37:31.837
- Hello? - Ms. Min.

517
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:33.566
We caught the jerk.

518
00:37:48.446 --> 00:37:49.886
Our house is uncomfortable, right?

519
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.287
Wait here. I'll get the documents.

520
00:37:52.287 --> 00:37:53.827
It's fine. We don't have time.

521
00:37:53.827 --> 00:37:56.127
Beggars can't be choosers.

522
00:37:56.127 --> 00:37:57.127
Let's go in.

523
00:38:04.566 --> 00:38:06.866
Sang Ho and Min Ho met...

524
00:38:06.866 --> 00:38:08.866
at 2pm on the eighth.

525
00:38:10.377 --> 00:38:11.537
After he left,

526
00:38:11.537 --> 00:38:12.977
he spoke with Cho Gap Soo...

527
00:38:12.977 --> 00:38:14.877
At 3:23pm.

528
00:38:14.877 --> 00:38:16.377
At 3:23pm.

529
00:38:17.747 --> 00:38:19.917
He sent me that final text...

530
00:38:19.917 --> 00:38:21.417
at 4:30pm.

531
00:38:21.616 --> 00:38:24.557
It's less than an hour from the jail to his home.

532
00:38:24.557 --> 00:38:27.187
He left the prison and spoke to Cho Gap Soo,

533
00:38:27.187 --> 00:38:29.696
and got home before texting me.

534
00:38:29.696 --> 00:38:30.827
His time of death...

535
00:38:30.827 --> 00:38:33.267
is between 6pm and 12am on the 8th.

536
00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:35.366
That's when he wrote the suicide note.

537
00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:36.397
Suicide note.

538
00:38:36.767 --> 00:38:37.796
Suicide note.

539
00:38:47.307 --> 00:38:48.877

00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:11.267
Yes. We need to check something.

543
00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:14.636
What is it about?

544
00:39:24.316 --> 00:39:25.787
We're reopening the investigation.

Let me take a look.

546
00:39:28.886 --> 00:39:30.357
Yes, sir.

547
00:39:31.057 --> 00:39:33.827
It should be in the evidence room.

548
00:39:33.986 --> 00:39:34.986
Come with me.

549
00:39:48.537 --> 00:39:49.537
Here.

550
00:39:50.276 --> 00:39:51.276
This is it.

551
00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:53.707
Let me know when you're done.

552
00:39:54.077 --> 00:39:55.077
Thank you.

The one in the picture is the real one,

557
00:40:10.997 --> 00:40:14.196
and this one was swapped out by someone.

558
00:40:14.696 --> 00:40:15.897
Probably Cho Gap Soo, right?

559
00:40:16.966 --> 00:40:17.997
I doubt it.

560
00:40:18.037 --> 00:40:20.236
He would've gotten rid of the pen entirely,

561
00:40:20.466 --> 00:40:22.107
since he has to cover up the crime.

562
00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:25.676
Then who swapped the pens?

563
00:40:26.207 --> 00:40:28.147
What did they want to check?

564
00:40:28.776 --> 00:40:30.216
It may be someone...

565
00:40:30.216 --> 00:40:33.017
who suspected Baek Sang Ho didn't commit suicide.

566
00:40:33.187 --> 00:40:34.787
If they suspected foul play,

567

it may be someone who knew him.

I'm sure you know the most about the Kingdom.

Give me all that you know about the Kingdom,

676
00:49:57.147 --> 00:49:58.417
Take this secret...

677
00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:02.147
to your grave.

678
00:50:17.997 --> 00:50:19.207
That's right.

679
00:50:20.006 --> 00:50:21.866
Sang Ho...

680
00:50:22.807 --> 00:50:26.207
wouldn't kill a person that easily.

681
00:50:48.196 --> 00:50:51.466
How's our esteemed commissioner of police?

682
00:50:53.566 --> 00:50:56.807
Yes, yes. I'm doing well, thanks to you.

683
00:50:58.136 --> 00:51:01.247
Yes. I actually have a favor to ask.

684
00:51:02.846 --> 00:51:05.546
Yes. I'm looking for a person.

685
00:51:07.017 --> 00:51:08.287
The person's name?

686
00:51:10.616 --> 00:51:11.917
Yes.

687
00:51:15.287 --> 00:51:17.096
It's Choi Gyung Ja.

688
00:51:21.426 --> 00:51:22.667
You know this pen, don't you?

689
00:51:32.707 --> 00:51:34.107
I don't know.

690
00:51:36.316 --> 00:51:37.517
Baek Sang Ho.

691
00:51:38.616 --> 00:51:40.417
You know he was murdered, don't you?

692
00:51:42.386 --> 00:51:43.517
Pardon?

693
00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:52.057
He was found dead after meeting with Cho Gap Soo.

694
00:51:52.897 --> 00:51:55.767
I think he was murdered by Cho Gap Soo.

695
00:51:58.937 --> 00:52:00.366
If we can find proof,

696
00:52:00.837 --> 00:52:03.136
we can uncover the truth behind his death.

697
00:52:03.136 --> 00:52:06.147
That's why we came here to see you.

698
00:52:10.747 --> 00:52:12.176
(November 8, 2017)

699
00:52:39.846 --> 00:52:41.307
When I heard what happened,

700
00:52:41.577 --> 00:52:43.946
I couldn't believe it and I rushed to the scene.

701
00:52:44.517 --> 00:52:46.386
Look at this handwriting.

702
00:52:48.616 --> 00:52:51.156
Did you see Kim last night?

703
00:52:51.156 --> 00:52:52.986
- Yes, sir. - Seriously.

704
00:52:52.986 --> 00:52:55.457
- Yes, sir. - "Forget dinner."

705
00:52:55.457 --> 00:52:57.096
- "Let's grab coffee." - I know.

706
00:52:57.096 --> 00:52:58.296
- And... - Excuse me.

707
00:53:00.767 --> 00:53:02.736
Are you done processing the scene?

708
00:53:02.736 --> 00:53:04.937
What is there to process? It's a simple suicide.

709
00:53:04.937 --> 00:53:07.667
I heard his position was strange.

710
00:53:08.006 --> 00:53:10.406
How could he hang himself while sitting?

711
00:53:12.377 --> 00:53:14.207
What doesn't make sense?

712
00:53:14.247 --> 00:53:16.946
It was a suicide, so we're saying it's suicide.

713
00:53:16.946 --> 00:53:19.017
Were there signs of foul play?

714
00:53:19.616 --> 00:53:21.417
You need to investigate more closely.

715
00:53:21.417 --> 00:53:23.386
Seriously. You're annoying.

716
00:53:24.156 --> 00:53:25.316
Who are you?

717
00:53:25.417 --> 00:53:28.156
Who are you to tell me what to do in my district?

718
00:53:28.156 --> 00:53:30.596
It's because you're not investigating properly!

719
00:53:30.596 --> 00:53:31.656
- What? - That's right.

720
00:53:31.656 --> 00:53:32.727
- What? - That's right!

721
00:53:32.727 --> 00:53:34.296
Why you little...

722
00:53:34.296 --> 00:53:36.796
- Stop it. - Come at me.

723
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:38.796
Get over here, you punk!

724
00:53:41.607 --> 00:53:44.307
Get off of me. Who does he think he is?

725
00:53:45.006 --> 00:53:47.477
- Let go. - My heart.

726
00:53:47.477 --> 00:53:49.846
I'm going to report all of you for assault.

727
00:53:49.877 --> 00:53:53.116
You'll report me? Fine. Go ahead. Report me.

728
00:53:53.116 --> 00:53:55.787
Go ahead. You'd better do it. Let go!

729
00:53:55.787 --> 00:53:58.287
Let go! Let go of me!

730
00:54:00.287 --> 00:54:02.287
That ignorant brute.

731
00:54:02.596 --> 00:54:04.497
You don't investigate with brute force.

732
00:54:07.596 --> 00:54:09.837
Something seemed off.

733
00:54:10.636 --> 00:54:12.707
There were so many things that were suspicious,

734
00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:15.136
but they were rushing to close the case.

735
00:54:15.437 --> 00:54:18.136
That's why I took that, although I knew...

736
00:54:18.977 --> 00:54:20.506
it was wrong.

737
00:54:20.846 --> 00:54:22.477
Did you have this tested?

738
00:54:23.877 --> 00:54:25.676
There were two people's fingerprints.

739
00:54:25.787 --> 00:54:27.986
But there was nothing to compare them to.

740
00:54:31.457 --> 00:54:33.627
I bet it was Cho Gap Soo and Baek Sang Ho.

741
00:54:35.426 --> 00:54:37.457
We'll take this and have it analyzed.

742
00:54:40.526 --> 00:54:41.627
You know,

743
00:54:42.966 --> 00:54:44.337
I owe...

744
00:54:45.196 --> 00:54:46.807
Detective Baek a lot.

745
00:54:47.707 --> 00:54:49.707
This is all I can do...

746
00:54:50.207 --> 00:54:51.736
because I'm incompetent.

747
00:54:53.247 --> 00:54:54.307
Please.

748
00:54:56.276 --> 00:54:57.377
I'm relying on you.

749
00:55:00.147 --> 00:55:01.287
Please solve this case.

750
00:55:11.127 --> 00:55:13.026
Let's go see Min Ho.

751
00:55:17.736 --> 00:55:19.207
Choi Gyung Ja and Kwak Young Shil...

752
00:55:19.207 --> 00:55:21.037
are both here, as you had predicted.

753
00:55:21.437 --> 00:55:24.607
Kwak Young Shil is living as Choi Gyung Sun.

754
00:55:27.077 --> 00:55:28.747
She's alive,

755
00:55:29.616 --> 00:55:30.977
is that it?

756
00:55:31.546 --> 00:55:32.616
What should I do?

757
00:56:02.816 --> 00:56:04.147
Kill them.

758
00:56:05.816 --> 00:56:07.386
Kill them both.

759
00:56:18.497 --> 00:56:21.366
What's wrong? What's going on?

760
00:56:21.366 --> 00:56:22.466
Keep running.

761
00:56:37.816 --> 00:56:40.346
One of the fingerprints lifted from this...

762
00:56:40.346 --> 00:56:42.187
was your brother's.

763
00:56:42.957 --> 00:56:45.457
Once we confirm the other is Cho Gap Soo's,

764
00:56:45.457 --> 00:56:48.227
with the ink analysis of the suicide note,

765
00:56:48.727 --> 00:56:51.926
we should be able to arrest him for murder.

766
00:56:51.926 --> 00:56:53.167
Then let's do that first.

767
00:56:53.167 --> 00:56:55.767
No. That won't be enough.

768
00:56:56.566 --> 00:56:59.406
It's obvious we won't be able to lock him up...

769
00:56:59.736 --> 00:57:01.837
for more than five years for murder.

770
00:57:01.837 --> 00:57:03.437
If he asserts...

771
00:57:03.906 --> 00:57:06.307
it was suicide and gets away with it,

772
00:57:06.607 --> 00:57:08.577
he'll get out in less than a year.

773
00:57:12.886 --> 00:57:13.886
We'll make sure...

774
00:57:14.546 --> 00:57:17.787
Cho Gap Soo rots in jail for the rest of his life.

775
00:57:17.787 --> 00:57:20.087
How? You said there's no way.

776
00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:21.857
We're preparing a special investigation.

777
00:57:22.596 --> 00:57:23.926
So,

778
00:57:23.926 --> 00:57:25.796
team up with us.

779
00:57:26.827 --> 00:57:28.026
You said you wanted...

780
00:57:28.627 --> 00:57:30.267
to avenge your brother's death.

781
00:57:32.037 --> 00:57:33.267
Let's catch...

782
00:57:34.337 --> 00:57:35.807
Cho Gap Soo.

783
00:57:39.406 --> 00:57:40.776
Where's the journal...

784
00:57:41.176 --> 00:57:42.647
your brother left behind?

785
00:57:47.346 --> 00:57:49.087
There's a what?

786
00:57:50.287 --> 00:57:51.616
Sang Ho's...

787
00:57:52.656 --> 00:57:53.787
journal?

788
00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.057
Hello.

789
00:58:27.627 --> 00:58:30.327
I'm Ma Yi Deum of special investigation team.
