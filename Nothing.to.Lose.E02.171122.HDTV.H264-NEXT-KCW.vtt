00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.520
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.469
- Are you all right?
- I'm not all right. Not at all.

3
00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.039
Obviously not.
How could I be all right?

4
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.389
- Anyway.
- Okay. I understand.

5
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.860
Judge Lee Jung Joo, correct?

6
00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.669
I'm Judge Sah Eui Hyun of
the Individual Criminal Judges.

7
00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:03.340
- I need to tell you something.
- No, thank you.

8
00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.730
I hear young judges these days
enjoy coffee.

9
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.230
Is green tea okay?

10
00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.139
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

11
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.939
Depending on the situation,

12
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.840
that trouble
can cover bigger trouble.

13
00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.010
Pardon?

14
00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:41.980
What do you mean?

15
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.779
I mean disgracing the court once
is more than enough.

16
00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.820
- Yes, sir.
- Judge Lee.

17
00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:53.120
Jang Soon Bok's retrial
is your case, isn't it?

18
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.520
Please do your best on the retrial.

19
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.070
Did they find out
that I lost the case file already?

20
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.439
Hey, Judge Knucklehead.

21
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.180
You know how I'm
the Knucklehead Prosecutor?

22
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.450
You're the knucklehead
among the judges,

23
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.550
so, how's "Judge Knucklehead"?

24
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.779
Judge Knucklehead.

25
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.689
Hey. What do you think about
you and I becoming...

26
00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.420
the legal world's
Knucklehead Couple?

27
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.860
What about we go
and register our marriage?

28
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.830
Listen. Then our child will be
the biggest knucklehead in history.

29
00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.430
Stop it already.

30
00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.939
I'm just worried about you.

31
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.870
Will anyone marry you like this?

32
00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.740
If no one will marry me,
I'll just marry them.

33
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.879
I'm saying you should marry me.

34
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.379
Listen. I can give you
a life of luxury.

35
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.979
Keep it up,
and I'll foam at the mouth.

36
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.960
I need to go to the police
because someone stole my purse.

37
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.090
Just your purse?

38
00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.529
- What about your shoe?
- My shoe...

39
00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.069
What? How did you know?

40
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.240
My case file.

41
00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.170
Thank goodness, you're here.

42
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.039
Don't kiss that.

43
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.650
I wish I were that case file.

44
00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.550
Why is this here?

45
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.620
The police will call you. Ask them.

46
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.789
Can't you tell me yourself?

47
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.259
I tried but...

48
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.590
"No, thank you."

49
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.029
- That's what you said.
- When did I say that?

50
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.129
I'm Judge Sah Eui Hyun of
the Individual Criminal Judges.

51
00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.870
- I need to tell you something.
- No, thank you.

52
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.180
Then...

53
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.210
when I said, "No thank you,"
you meant...

54
00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.210
this?

55
00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.349
It's fine. Just be more careful
with your case files.

56
00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.950
Don't take off your robe
in court either.

57
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.289
I won't take it off anymore.

58
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.759
If I take off my robe in court
ever again,

59
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.170
I'm your woman.

60
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.270
Hey, Jung Joo.

61
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.310
As in I won't take it off
over my dead body.

62
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.810
I'll wear my robe in the courtroom.

63
00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.140
I need to review my case file,
so take her out.

64
00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.010
I'm very, very grateful
that you found this for me.

65
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.719
But you're largely at fault
for my saying, "No, thank you."

66
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.289
If only you hadn't hit me
with the door...

67
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.229
Look. Do you see that lump?
The lump.

68
00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:57.599
That doesn't compare to gum.

69
00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:00.310
Gum?

70
00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.479
Get out. Just get out. Now.

71
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.179
- Let's go.
- Hello, Mr. Cha.

72
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.950
How is Jang Soon Bok?

73
00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.029
Mom.

74
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.330
The doctor says she might be
able to wake up right away,

75
00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.500
but it's too early to tell, and
we should observe her for now.

76
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.570
I see.

77
00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.380
He deserves to be trampled
over like a maggot!

78
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.349
See? Look at this!

79
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.919
It seems this was recorded
without permission.

80
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.820
Should we take legal actions?

81
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.890
The view has skyrocketed.

82
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.659
If this video goes viral,
Jang Soon Bok's suicide attempt...

83
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.260
might go away.

84
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.599
Whether it's the press
or the public,

85
00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.330
they'd find a judge's outbreak far
more interesting than a defendant's.

86
00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:07.070
It'd be more if that judge happened
to be a young, female judge.

87
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.049
Was it Judge Lee Jung Joo?

88
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.380
Let's give them Lee Jung Joo
and cover up Jang Soon Bok's case.

89
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.130
Are they serious?
Why are they criticizing only me?

90
00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.099
Some people almost died
because of him.

91
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.429
He deserves to be trampled
over like a maggot!

92
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.630
Gosh, that startled me.

93
00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:37.099
Hello?

94
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.510
This is Detective Kang Chul Soo
from Seocho Police Station.

95
00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:43.010
- Is this Judge Lee Jung Joo?
- Yes.

96
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.210
Have you received your bag
from Judge Sah Eui Hyun?

97
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.840
Had I known he was famous
and was even on the news in the US,

98
00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:19.710
I would have gotten an autograph.

99
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.090
(Sah Eui Hyun)

100
00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.330
We have tragic news.
A shooting has taken place...

101
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.830
inside a classroom
at Harvard Law School.

102
00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:43.969
The shooter, identified
as law student, Calin,

103
00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.239
killed 3 people during
an 11-minute shooting spree.

104
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.710
Fortunately, the chaos was stopped
by a courageous man,

105
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.409
Sah Eui Hyun,
a judge from South Korea.

106
00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:55.549
He wanted to end it all.

107
00:07:55.549 --> 00:07:57.979
He needed help from someone
just like you.

108
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.020
- You're home.
- She was reading.

109
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.020
Hello.

110
00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:03.890
Are you watching it again?

111
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.489
I keep wanting to watch it.
I can't get enough of it.

112
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.900
My gosh, I have an amazing son.

113
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:12.529
- I'm going to wash up now.
- Do you want a drink?

114
00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:16.599
A can of beer won't cloud your
judgment while writing your ruling.

115
00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:19.270
Hit the ground! You're going to...

116
00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:25.080
Not today. I think
it might get me drunk today.

117
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.880
Did something happen
that you'd get drunk from one beer?

118
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.650
I had a small accident
in court today.

119
00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:35.419
- An accident?
- In one of my cases, a defendant,

120
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.290
Jang Soon Bok, murdered and
chopped her husband's body.

121
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.759
I know her.

122
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.229
I was the presiding judge
of her first trial.

123
00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:44.229
You were?

124
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.200
I remember her son was suffering
from a mental disability.

125
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.099
How do you remember that?

126
00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:51.910
The man
whom Jang Soon Book killed...

127
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.879
managed the cottage of Do Jin Myung.

128
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.680
He was annoyed that the husband
died as soon as he hired him.

129
00:08:59.109 --> 00:09:00.879
Did you know that
she applied for a retrial?

130
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.379
A retrial?

131
00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:24.599
What are you doing?

132
00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:26.340
You scared me!

133
00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:28.410
Is blaming others your hobby?

134
00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:32.180
Putting myself in someone else's
shoes is my talent.

135
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.719
Well,

136
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.690
I do agree that you might see me
as blaming it on you, Judge Sah.

137
00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:45.729
I'd like to offer my sincerest
gratitude and apologies.

138
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.129
I wouldn't want you to think
being ungrateful is my habit.

139
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.310
I wasn't done talking to you.

140
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.690
What is this? What?

141
00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:23.160
What's going on? What is this?

142
00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:33.070
Why would you put your robe on
like that?

143
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.670
Were you trying to attack me?

144
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.780
It's you, Judge Lee,
who's wearing...

145
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.019
my robe.

146
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.660
I won't attack you, so take it off.

147
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.629
It wasn't like I wanted
to wear your robe.

148
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.160
I'm taking it off right now.

149
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.450
(Judge Knucklehead)

150
00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:23.619
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

151
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.989
Whatever. She never picks up
the first time I call her.

152
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.099
Her phone is just
an answering machine.

153
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.450
I thought you were
done talking.

154
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:48.920
I was just getting started.

155
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.749
Beggars can't be choosers.

156
00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.759
There was an unfortunate incident
during Jang Soon Bok's trial.

157
00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.790
Are you asking me
about her condition?

158
00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:01.129
Yes, I'm in charge of writing...

159
00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:02.899
the ruling for her case.

160
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.499
She's unconscious.

161
00:12:05.499 --> 00:12:07.700
We need to monitor her to see
whether she wakes up or not.

162
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.310
I heard from Prosecutor Do...

163
00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:16.639
that you recorded
a video of the trial.

164
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.710
I'd like to take a look at that.

165
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.119
We already deleted the video.

166
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.180
Sorry? Hold on.

167
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.420
Hang on.

168
00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:30.420
If you were going to delete
the video this quickly,

169
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.859
why did you bother filming it?

170
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.530
I wanted to record the trial,

171
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.259
but deleting it was a suggestion
made by my superiors.

172
00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:42.399
By superiors, do you mean
the Chief Justice or the head chief?

173
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.940
The Chief Justice personally
requested me...

174
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.680
to do my best
for Jang Soon Bok's retrial.

175
00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:53.310
Why would he suggest to delete it?

176
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.080
If you have questions, ask him.

177
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.979
Is this how you're going to treat
me, out of all people?

178
00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:01.290
What do you mean?

179
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.759
You heard me.

180
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:09.599
You and I are very special
when it comes to Jang Soon Bok.

181
00:13:09.859 --> 00:13:12.269
Think how we both had the same case
around the same time.

182
00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:14.830
Larceny and retrial are
two different matters.

183
00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:20.810
You found the case file
that I almost lost.

184
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.440
I would've done the same
for anyone, not just you.

185
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.710
My goodness.

186
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.379
Aren't you bothered that Jang
Soon Bok attempted suicide...

187
00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:30.649
during her trial and that
she's on the brink of death?

188
00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:36.920
I'm only asking
because it's bothering me too.

189
00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:40.259
Think about to whom she would want
to show the video the most...

190
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.830
when she asked you
to record the trial.

191
00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:52.810
(My innocence is your guilt.)

192
00:13:57.109 --> 00:13:58.710
Did she really try
to commit suicide?

193
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.979
Medically speaking, yes.

194
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.820
She has diabetes,
so she gets insulin shots.

195
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.119
After getting her shot yesterday,

196
00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:09.060
she skipped breakfast and lunch
before coming here.

197
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.790
I think she was trying to die
from hypoglycemia.

198
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:13.389
Why would she?

199
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:15.960
According to the prison guard,
she was in despair after...

200
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.629
her lawyer squashed her hopes
of getting a retrial.

201
00:14:19.469 --> 00:14:21.330
She lost all hope.

202
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.269
"My innocence is your guilt."

203
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.540
Was she really wrongfully accused?

204
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.979
Do you know how many criminals
would say that they're wronged?

205
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.810
When serial killers are apprehended,

206
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.249
they say it's unfair
because they can't kill anymore.

207
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.889
I really wanted to see the video.

208
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.790
Why would they delete the video?

209
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.690
You know what?

210
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.629
The presiding judge
for her first trial was...

211
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:53.599
Sah Jung Do, the president
of Jungmyung Law Office.

212
00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:55.269
What do you take me for?

213
00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.310
Goodness. Did you know his son
is Judge Sah Eui Hyun?

214
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:02.009
What?

215
00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:04.009
Hold on.

216
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:07.479
Yes, Mom.

217
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.920
Is that Professor Yoo?

218
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.759
- Professor!
- Hi.

219
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:19.790
This is awesome. I've missed you.

220
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.430
People will think she's your mom.

221
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.930
I thought you'd be in hiding
because of the video.

222
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.030
You look fine.

223
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.200
You see...

224
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.609
how everyone is staring at me,
right?

225
00:15:31.869 --> 00:15:34.609
Maybe standing next to you
will make me less self-conscious.

226
00:15:34.609 --> 00:15:36.910
Then stick to me like glue.

227
00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:39.609
- Hello.
- Hi.

228
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.820
People will think my mom
is a Chief Justice.

229
00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:46.820
She could've been
if she didn't join the law school.

230
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.960
When she was a judge,
her reputation was through the roof.

231
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.660
Eui Hyun, long time no see.

232
00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.099
Eat with us.

233
00:15:56.729 --> 00:15:57.859
Enjoy your lunch.

234
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:02.969
What?
Did he just diss you too?

235
00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:04.300
- Hey.
- Let him be.

236
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:07.210
How do you know him?

237
00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:10.280
He and Han Joon
used to be inseparable.

238
00:16:15.304 --> 00:16:18.536
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E02 Nothing to Lose "Nothing to Lose"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

239
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.330
You're meeting Kim Joo Hyung? Alone?

240
00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.660
Yes. The court must have decided
that there's a need...

241
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.670
to check his mental state,

242
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.430
and asked me directly.

243
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.800
The panel who heard his case...

244
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.710
I didn't know...

245
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.369
that the expert my chief mentioned
was Professor Yoo.

246
00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:46.310
Have some omelet.
I know it's your favorite.

247
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.320
Give me some omelet too.

248
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.530
Pretty, please?

249
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.629
Give me.

250
00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:06.229
Mom, you give me.

251
00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.199
I don't like being second best.
Here.

252
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.209
Wasn't being a Con Law professor
enough?

253
00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:14.939
Why did you have to study
criminal psychology?

254
00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:17.379
Now, you have to meet with violent
criminals alone. It worries me.

255
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.480
If you dissect
Kim Joo Hyung's psyche,

256
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.649
can you analyze the garbage
that he spews out?

257
00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:23.780
Yes, I should.

258
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.520
That's why we have criminal
psychologists like me.

259
00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:29.859
You were crazy cool
when you were a judge too.

260
00:17:31.459 --> 00:17:32.530
Then again,

261
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.230
you saw right through what the
criminals were thinking then too.

262
00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:54.179
Kim Joo Hyung.

263
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.919
It's quiet here
thanks to Courtroom 11.

264
00:18:02.959 --> 00:18:06.889
It was such a headache
when things got rowdy here.

265
00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:09.260
You too, right?

266
00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:12.869
You should buy Judge Lee Jung Joo
dinner or something.

267
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.639
It looks like she'll be spared
from disciplinary action...

268
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.609
for diverting the attention from
here, so it's a good thing.

269
00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:24.580
Are you staying? I'm going
to head over to Courtroom 11.

270
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.649
Later. Oh, that's right.

271
00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:32.919
You got rid of the video
of Jang Soon Bok, right?

272
00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:35.959
I trust you.

273
00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:47.030
We will now begin...

274
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.199
the trial presided by
the 73rd Criminal Judicial Panel.

275
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.909
Case number 2017GO135.

276
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.409
Defendant, Kim Joo Hyung.

277
00:18:55.409 --> 00:18:56.439
Please bring him out.

278
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.250
(Defendant)

279
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.320
As the presiding judge,

280
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.280
let me give you a word of warning.

281
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.619
We, judges, will do our best
to ensure there is no more...

282
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.419
disgraceful behavior
in the court room...

283
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.629
and to uphold the prestige
of the court.

284
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.730
Defendant. Watch your language,
and show respect as well.

285
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.230
- But Your Honor...
- Defendant.

286
00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:55.899
Do not do anything
without proper reason.

287
00:19:55.899 --> 00:19:57.369
Every word you say...

288
00:19:57.439 --> 00:20:00.240
may make you guilty of contempt
of court and defamation.

289
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.409
Please keep that in mind.

290
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:06.780
Also, those of you in the audience,
do not record anything in court.

291
00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:08.750
Let us begin.

292
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.250
- I need to take a leak.
- Sit down.

293
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.619
There are no leaks here.

294
00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:25.970
He means...

295
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.199
he needs to urinate.

296
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.169
Urinate?

297
00:20:32.639 --> 00:20:35.340
Yes. Urinate.

298
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.490
- Must you go now?
- Yes.

299
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.659
Should I just go here?

300
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.800
Please take the defendant...

301
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.530
to the restroom.

302
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:02.369
We'll take a 10-minute recess.

303
00:21:26.659 --> 00:21:29.300
Defendant. Put down that knife!

304
00:21:30.959 --> 00:21:33.099
Mr. Kim Joo Hyung.
Please calm down.

305
00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:37.669
Please don't kill me.

306
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.879
Ask this lady judge to save you.

307
00:21:44.879 --> 00:21:45.949
Judge Lee.

308
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.379
What... What do you want?

309
00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:51.919
I'll tell this lady judge here!

310
00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:56.560
- So everyone but her, get out.
- But...

311
00:21:57.419 --> 00:21:58.760
I'm the presiding judge,

312
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.000
so talk to me.
Don't do anything reckless!

313
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.800
Okay?

314
00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:09.540
This is my case,
so talk to me instead.

315
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.040
Don't do anything you'll regret.

316
00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:34.159
I'll stay!

317
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.459
Everyone, please leave.

318
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.899
- Judge Lee.
- Judge Lee.

319
00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:46.740
Let her go. I said I'd stay behind.

320
00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:51.139
Judge Lee Jung Joo of
the 73rd Criminal Judicial Panel...

321
00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:53.709
has been taken hostage by
the defendant,

322
00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:56.649
serial child rapist Kim Joo Hyung.

323
00:22:56.649 --> 00:22:58.149
The police state...

324
00:22:58.149 --> 00:23:01.290
that Judge Lee Jung Joo's safety
is top priority,

325
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.929
and are carefully considering
sending in special forces.

326
00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:07.090
Since there aren't any
clear matters for negotiation,

327
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.859
there is a high probability
that this hostage situation...

328
00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:11.500
will be prolonged.

329
00:23:12.199 --> 00:23:14.830
Why was Judge Lee Jung Joo
taken hostage?

330
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.939
Does it have to do with the video
circulating online?

331
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:18.040
Please tell us.

332
00:23:19.409 --> 00:23:21.169
What led to this event?

333
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.780
Why was a judge taken hostage?

334
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.379
- Please give us a statement!
- Yes, well...

335
00:23:27.379 --> 00:23:29.919
We will make an official statement
shortly,

336
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.389
so please refrain from
making speculations.

337
00:23:32.389 --> 00:23:34.250
Your cooperation is appreciated.

338
00:23:34.959 --> 00:23:37.320
Please give us a statement now.

339
00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:39.359
(Defendant)

340
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.530
Judge Lee.

341
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.500
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

342
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:51.139
I'll tell you what I want.

343
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:59.050
You know,

344
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.649
I really don't like this.

345
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:07.050
I need you to take care of it
for me.

346
00:24:07.889 --> 00:24:09.290
(Trial for Serial Child Rape)

347
00:24:12.459 --> 00:24:14.899
My handwritten confession.

348
00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:17.959
Do you think getting rid of this
will get rid of your crime?

349
00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:20.669
You keep saying my "crime",

350
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:22.869
but what I did wasn't a crime.

351
00:24:22.869 --> 00:24:24.000
It is a crime.

352
00:24:24.369 --> 00:24:27.669
The most deplorable,
unforgivable crime.

353
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:29.340
You're so dense.

354
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.439
I told you over and over.

355
00:24:31.439 --> 00:24:33.849
It was sex education.

356
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.149
You made this
although I'm innocent,

357
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.590
so I need you to burn this yourself.

358
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.359
The one who made it
needs to destroy it...

359
00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:48.359
so that I can walk out of here...

360
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.730
with my head held high.

361
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.099
With your head held high?

362
00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:55.740
After doing such heinous things
to those small children?

363
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.709
(Trial for Serial Child Rape)

364
00:24:58.709 --> 00:25:01.409
What do I do?
I don't hate this attitude.

365
00:25:07.649 --> 00:25:10.649
It's not good
if you make me like you so much.

366
00:25:11.419 --> 00:25:13.020
Don't set my heart on fire.

367
00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:16.820
Just burn this already.

368
00:25:21.189 --> 00:25:24.459
I can't. I can't burn this
and acquit you.

369
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:31.470
Then take off your clothes.

370
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.179
I will let you see for yourself
it wasn't rape.

371
00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:41.980
I can die with no regrets.

372
00:25:42.379 --> 00:25:43.980
In this sacred courtroom,

373
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:47.550
I get to hold the very first sex
education class with a female judge.

374
00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:51.119
I'm ecstatic.

375
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.330
Is it legal for you
to give me these thrills?

376
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.230
Judge Lee Jung Joo.

377
00:26:03.699 --> 00:26:05.709
Do you think you'll get away
with this?

378
00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:08.580
I told you already. I won't have
any regrets even if I die.

379
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.709
I can ask you one last time.

380
00:26:13.709 --> 00:26:14.709
Will you take it off...

381
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.550
or burn it?

382
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.590
Take off your clothes.

383
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.109
I said to take it off,

384
00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.849
Judge Lee Jung Joo.

385
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.209
Don't you dare even touch her.
Or I'm going to kill you myself.

386
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.040
It's because I don't want to
fight with you...

387
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.240
over a woman.

388
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.980
- What are you scared of?
- I'm scared that my decision...

389
00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.349
would be about being successful.

390
00:27:20.349 --> 00:27:22.550
A successful judge
doesn't make misjudgments.

391
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.550
I'm not sure if Lee Jung Joo can
get out of this mess.

392
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.649
Please take it off.
