1
00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:39.295
Did you sleep well?

2
00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:44.335
Your eyes are swollen.

3
00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:51.445
Don't cry from now on.

4
00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:54.714
Promise?

5
00:00:58.445 --> 00:00:59.714
I promise.

6
00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:03.354
Aren't you hungry?

7
00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.685
I am.

8
00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.735
The house is a little old. It must have been cold last night.

9
00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:21.575
No, the floor was really warm.

10
00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:23.974
It wasn't cold at all thanks to the covers you gave us.

11
00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:28.674
We neither have a television nor computer. You must have been bored.

12
00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.314
We don't own much.

13
00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:33.844
- Please understand. - It's fine.

14
00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:36.915
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

15
00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:38.025
Eat up.

16
00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:43.224
What do you want to eat?

17
00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:44.525
You should eat what you want.

18
00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:54.875
Eat up.

19
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.575
- Is it delicious? - Yes.

20
00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:17.024
You have such...

21
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:19.565
big eyes and nose.

22
00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:21.494
You have pretty lips too.

23
00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:25.964
I was wondering how someone could look so pretty.

24
00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.475
But now, I remember seeing you on television.

25
00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:32.445
Thank you for everything. Thanks to you, we slept well...

26
00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:36.244
and had a great breakfast. I heard the car has been fixed too.

27
00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.885
We won't bother you anymore.

28
00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:42.285
You speak so kindly.

29
00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:46.855
I didn't know that young people could be like that.

30
00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:48.424
Pardon?

31
00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:51.165
I meant your husband.

32
00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:53.394
Why?

33
00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:55.864
Yesterday, he was standing there...

34
00:02:55.964 --> 00:02:58.105
in the dark, anxious and worried.

35
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:00.904
- Yesterday? - Yes.

36
00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:02.505
Before you both came in.

37
00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:07.674
He came first and begged us to let you sleep for a night.

38
00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:10.415
I couldn't refuse.

39
00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.644
He said he didn't need to sleep...

40
00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.654
and that he just needed to get his wife a place to sleep.

41
00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:24.095
We are not from here,

42
00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:27.295
and there aren't any young people here. So we were scared at first.

43
00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:30.795
But he seemed so urgent,

44
00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:32.605
so we let him in.

45
00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:33.834
Thank you.

46
00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:36.505
You chose well.

47
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:39.744
Yes. He's kind.

48
00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.274
He's not just kind.

49
00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.614
He has such a big heart.

50
00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:24.155
Excuse me.

51
00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:25.624
Yes?

52
00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:30.424
I'm sorry, but may I borrow your car for a moment?

53
00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:32.165
I need to visit the village.

54
00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:35.564
Your wife is here.

55
00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:37.465
You won't run away, right?

56
00:04:38.264 --> 00:04:40.205
Of course not. I'll be quick.

57
00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:14.634
Oh, my. This fits perfectly.

58
00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:19.645
Gosh. What is this?

59
00:05:25.884 --> 00:05:27.085
Thank you.

60
00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:30.485
For a young person, you're really nice...

61
00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:31.785
and pick up things quickly.

62
00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:34.494
How did you even think of this?

63
00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:31.514
Oh, there he is.

64
00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:54.775
(The 14th  : Before Sunrise)

65
00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:57.535
(The 14th story: Before Sunrise)

66
00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:03.345
Does a Sa Ho Sung work here?

67
00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:07.244
Sa Ho Sung? I've never heard that name before.

68
00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:09.684
Do you know "Love Cosmos"?

69
00:07:09.684 --> 00:07:11.924
It's someone who draws cosmos flowers.

70
00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:13.225
I don't.

71
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:15.655
Wasn't a box of mandarins delivered here from Jeju Island?

72
00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:16.754
No.

73
00:07:19.994 --> 00:07:23.364
If you ever hear of or meet Sa Ho Sung or Love Cosmos,

74
00:07:23.364 --> 00:07:25.304
please give me a call.

75
00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:26.835
Sure.

76
00:07:38.614 --> 00:07:41.514
Hi. I checked again, and it's that school.

77
00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:44.054
It's the only school with that name.

78
00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:48.254
Okay. Thanks.

79
00:07:50.924 --> 00:07:53.264
I think this is the right neighborhood.

80
00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:57.595
- Is it someone else? - No.

81
00:07:58.235 --> 00:07:59.934
I bet she ran away.

82
00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:03.374
Mom and Dad lost her right in front of their eyes many times.

83
00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:08.045
Since we're here, let's ask around the village.

84
00:08:11.744 --> 00:08:13.884
Her name is Sa Ho Sung.

85
00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:15.514
She's in her late 30s.

86
00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:18.485
Sa Ho Sung? A woman in her late 30s?

87
00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:21.624
This isn't a city center. There are no women in their 30s.

88
00:08:21.624 --> 00:08:23.095
There are only old people.

89
00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:28.634
Wait, there is one.

90
00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.905
A young woman lives behind the sacred tree.

91
00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:33.965
- Okay? - Soo Yeon? Soo Hyun?

92
00:08:34.134 --> 00:08:35.705
Yes, it's Lee Soo Hyun.

93
00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:38.274
She's the only young lady.

94
00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:44.845
I love it.

95
00:08:44.845 --> 00:08:49.154
I'll frame it and hang it up in a sunlit corner.

96
00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:55.725
(Community Center)

97
00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:03.164
- Hello. - Welcome.

98
00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:06.965
I brought this for all of you to drink.

99
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.774
Here you go.

100
00:09:08.774 --> 00:09:10.534
- Here. - This looks tasty.

101
00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:12.945
Have you heard of Sa Ho Sung?

102
00:09:12.945 --> 00:09:15.014
- Sa Ho Sun? - Sa Ho Sun?

103
00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:17.114
Sa Ho Sung, not Sa Ho Sun.

104
00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:19.914
- She doesn't live here. - Never heard the name before.

105
00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:21.654
I don't know her.

106
00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:23.715
Is Sa Ho Sung a person's name?

107
00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:25.955
There's no one with that name here.

108
00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:28.425
- You don't know? - Go to that room,

109
00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:31.595
and ask if the men know her.

110
00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:35.235
Hello, how are you?

111
00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:37.394
I'd like to ask you something.

112
00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:41.435
Do any of you know of a Sa Ho Sung who lives here?

113
00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:43.735
- Who? - Sa Ho Sung.

114
00:09:43.735 --> 00:09:47.044
Sa Ho Sung? I don't know that name.

115
00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:50.114
What's the name of the girl who lives behind the sacred tree?

116
00:09:51.144 --> 00:09:53.345
Her name is Soo Hyun.

117
00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:56.284
- Lee Soo Hyun. - Is it?

118
00:09:57.254 --> 00:09:58.254
Checkmate.

119
00:09:58.254 --> 00:10:01.794
Hello, ma'am, can I ask you something?

120
00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:05.225
Do you know if a Sa Ho Sung lives in the area?

121
00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:07.095
I don't know.

122
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:09.894
She's a young woman.

123
00:10:09.894 --> 00:10:11.435
I don't know.

124
00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:14.835
Sir, can I ask a question?

125
00:10:14.835 --> 00:10:17.435
Do you know if a Sa Ho Sung lives nearby?

126
00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:18.774
I don't know.

127
00:10:18.774 --> 00:10:21.774
Sa... Sa? I don't know.

128
00:10:21.774 --> 00:10:23.414
Sa Ho Sung?

129
00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:40.595
You're in no situation to be in...

130
00:10:40.595 --> 00:10:42.634
"My Wife's Ghost Marriage".

131
00:10:43.034 --> 00:10:44.534
If the chief finds out,

132
00:10:44.534 --> 00:10:46.735
he would bow to you in the lobby.

133
00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:48.004
That would be great.

134
00:10:48.935 --> 00:10:50.105
Let's not do it.

135
00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:52.244
Tell the director you can't do it.

136
00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:54.044
What's the point in not working?

137
00:10:54.044 --> 00:10:56.175
You want to die counting money.

138
00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.345
Is it because I'm always talking about money?

139
00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:01.154
No. I want to make a living too.

140
00:11:03.355 --> 00:11:06.055
I'm the housewives' EXO.

141
00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:11.494
I really think this is the wrong move.

142
00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:17.735
Wait. Think about it again.

143
00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:20.634
I'll be treated well and paid well. Isn't that just great?

144
00:11:28.044 --> 00:11:29.914
A meeting with Anthony?

145
00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:32.685
He's past his season and good for nothing.

146
00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.754
He's not even Sa Jin Jin's husband anymore,

147
00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:37.514
and his acting isn't that great. Why should I meet him?

148
00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:40.325
Don't you know we cast rookie actor Kim Min Chul?

149
00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:42.425
He said he'd come in for a meeting.

150
00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:45.595
I couldn't think of an excuse in time. I apologize.

151
00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:47.864
We have to make small talk if we meet him.

152
00:11:47.864 --> 00:11:50.534
Do you know how exhausting that is?

153
00:11:57.805 --> 00:12:01.414
I got your hopes up only to return to Seoul empty-handed.

154
00:12:01.914 --> 00:12:02.914
Sorry.

155
00:12:03.675 --> 00:12:05.445
I should apologize.

156
00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:07.855
You skipped work.

157
00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:09.855
What'll you do?

158
00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:13.085
Who cares? I'm delighted to skip work.

159
00:12:18.024 --> 00:12:20.124
I wonder where she is.

160
00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:31.205
What are you looking at?

161
00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:32.904
Look at this.

162
00:12:33.805 --> 00:12:36.715
It's Sa Jin Jin. Was that photoshopped?

163
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.244
No, she came to our school.

164
00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:40.345
Why?

165
00:12:41.715 --> 00:12:43.384
To find someone.

166
00:12:43.384 --> 00:12:46.355
- These mandarins are sweet. - There are more over there.

167
00:12:46.355 --> 00:12:48.994
Ms. Lee Soo Hyun had some sent from Jeju Island.

168
00:12:48.994 --> 00:12:51.124
Who's Ms. Lee?

169
00:12:51.124 --> 00:12:54.764
The art teacher who comes in to teach the kids after school.

170
00:12:56.335 --> 00:12:58.335
The teacher from Jeju Island?

171
00:12:58.335 --> 00:13:00.864
- Her name is Lee Soo Hyun? - Yes.

172
00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:21.754
A young woman...

173
00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:25.864
- lives behind the sacred tree. - Okay.

174
00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:28.634
Soo Yeon? Soo Hyun? Yes, it's Lee Soo Hyun.

175
00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:30.894
Her name is Soo Hyun.

176
00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.465
- Lee Soo Hyun. - Is it?

177
00:13:34.164 --> 00:13:35.475
Lee Soo Hyun.

178
00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:40.504
Lee Soo Hyun?

179
00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:55.825
(To Sa Ho Sung)

180
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:01.994
Okay.

181
00:14:02.994 --> 00:14:05.264
I found the box. Hang on.

182
00:14:10.274 --> 00:14:12.105
Here it is.

183
00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:17.315
"To Sa Ho Sung, from Lee Soo Hyun"

184
00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:33.095
- Okay, thanks. - Sure.

185
00:14:37.735 --> 00:14:39.465
It's her love letter.

186
00:14:39.565 --> 00:14:40.835
Min Ho.

187
00:14:41.274 --> 00:14:43.134
- Min Ho! - What?

188
00:14:49.544 --> 00:14:50.914
Is something wrong?

189
00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:52.985
Yes. We're going back.

191
00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:16.205
You saw that? Do you know Sa Jin Jin?

192
00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:17.975
She was here today.

193
00:15:19.874 --> 00:15:21.544
- Was she? - My goodness.

194
00:15:21.544 --> 00:15:24.815
Her eyes, nose, and mouth all fit in that tiny face.

195
00:15:24.914 --> 00:15:26.914
She was looking for someone.

196
00:15:26.914 --> 00:15:29.654
Whom could she be looking for in this countryside?

197
00:15:30.914 --> 00:15:33.925
Did you buy clothes? It suits you perfectly.

198
00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:36.425
You look so pretty, Soo Hyun.

199
00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:48.504
Hey.

200
00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:56.114
Hey. Ho Sung.

201
00:16:14.894 --> 00:16:18.205
It's Ji Won. Gong Ji Won.

202
00:16:20.465 --> 00:16:21.805
Ji Won.

203
00:17:18.024 --> 00:17:19.165
Pack up.

204
00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:23.564
I said pack up.

205
00:17:28.135 --> 00:17:29.435
You don't have much to pack anyway.

206
00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:31.344
Let's just go.

207
00:17:32.145 --> 00:17:33.145
Get up.

208
00:17:37.244 --> 00:17:39.685
I said get up. We're going home.

209
00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:41.084
This is my home.

210
00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:45.554
Come to your senses, Ho Sung.

211
00:17:47.225 --> 00:17:49.455
No, what was it?

212
00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:51.365
Lee Soo Hyun?

213
00:17:52.324 --> 00:17:53.594
Why are you Lee Soo Hyun?

214
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:55.834
Why is your name Lee Soo Hyun?

215
00:17:59.764 --> 00:18:01.804
Your love must be really important.

216
00:18:12.915 --> 00:18:14.284
Goodness.

217
00:18:28.264 --> 00:18:32.564
(Sender: Lee Soo Hyun, Receiver: Sa Ho Sung)

(Receiver: Sa Ho Sung)

219
00:18:43.514 --> 00:18:45.885
(Sender: Lee Soo Hyun, Receiver: Sa Ho Sung)

220
00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:48.915
How important was him for you to abandon your own family,

221
00:18:49.314 --> 00:18:52.455
break your own parents' hearts, and change your name?

222
00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:55.854
You should've at least led a good life after making us all suffer.

223
00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:57.725
That was the least you could've done for us.

224
00:18:58.324 --> 00:19:00.465
Did you choose love over family just to go into hiding...

225
00:19:00.465 --> 00:19:02.235
and lead a life like this?

226
00:19:02.965 --> 00:19:04.264
I'm happy.

227
00:19:05.334 --> 00:19:06.334
What?

228
00:19:14.344 --> 00:19:15.445
Fine.

229
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.145
I can clearly see that you're happy.

230
00:19:19.514 --> 00:19:20.615
Let's go now.

231
00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:22.754
Get up.

232
00:19:22.854 --> 00:19:24.524
- I said I won't go. - Why not?

233
00:19:24.524 --> 00:19:25.955
This is my home.

234
00:19:26.824 --> 00:19:28.195
You should go home.

235
00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:30.925
You're crazy.

236
00:19:34.794 --> 00:19:37.735
Let's go. Get up right now. Mom's waiting for you.

237
00:19:37.735 --> 00:19:40.465
Let's hurry home. Mom's waiting.

238
00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:47.175
She's sick.

239
00:19:47.744 --> 00:19:50.415
Because of you, she's sick.

240
00:19:51.244 --> 00:19:53.044
She got sick from waiting for you to come home.

241
00:19:53.645 --> 00:19:55.084
Who are you to make Mom sick?

242
00:19:57.314 --> 00:19:59.554
Die. You should just die.

243
00:20:00.024 --> 00:20:01.955
You should die so that she doesn't have to wait for you.

244
00:20:02.094 --> 00:20:05.195
Do me a favor, and just die. I just want you to die!

245
00:20:05.665 --> 00:20:08.465
I just wish you'd be gone. I want you to disappear from this world.

(Jeong Eun)

247
00:21:08.494 --> 00:21:09.794
The number you have dialed is...

(President Jang Ki Bong)

249
00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:26.044
- Hi. - I got you a meeting for the role.

250
00:21:26.844 --> 00:21:28.774
The day after tomorrow in Sinsa-dong at 7pm.

251
00:21:29.814 --> 00:21:31.844
- You're coming, right? - Of course.

252
00:21:31.844 --> 00:21:33.415
When are you moving into the office?

253
00:21:34.014 --> 00:21:36.054
I'm paying the fee alone until you move in.

254
00:21:36.054 --> 00:21:37.314
I said I'll move in soon.

255
00:21:43.895 --> 00:21:47.494
Gosh, it's winter again which means this year is almost over again.

256
00:21:48.135 --> 00:21:49.135
- Ms. Han, - Yes?

257
00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.435
what are you doing for Christmas?

258
00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:52.004
I don't know.

259
00:21:52.564 --> 00:21:54.064
Do you want to hang out with me?

260
00:21:55.205 --> 00:21:57.574
On Christmas? Don't you have a date?

261
00:21:57.804 --> 00:21:59.044
No, I don't.

262
00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:00.544
Why not?

263
00:22:00.544 --> 00:22:03.415
I'm getting married on Christmas.

264
00:22:03.415 --> 00:22:06.084
- What? - I'm getting married on Christmas.

265
00:22:06.544 --> 00:22:07.715
Are you serious?

266
00:22:08.385 --> 00:22:10.485
My gosh, congratulations.

267
00:22:12.054 --> 00:22:16.294
But why are you rushing to get married?

268
00:22:19.494 --> 00:22:21.334
We have everything we need for our marriage.

269
00:22:21.735 --> 00:22:22.764
Sorry?

270
00:22:26.735 --> 00:22:27.774
No way.

271
00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:31.244
Why are you blushing like a kid?

272
00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:36.814
I'm glad you guys have all that you need.

273
00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:38.844
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

274
00:22:39.145 --> 00:22:41.014
Do you want to come to the bridal shop?

275
00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:42.054
Me?

276
00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:46.554
I think you need to get your own dress soon too.

277
00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:48.354
Reum.

278
00:22:48.754 --> 00:22:49.955
Hi.

279
00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:52.264
Get in!

280
00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:57.195
Ji Hye is getting married on Christmas.

281
00:22:57.395 --> 00:22:58.665
- Is that so? - Yes.

282
00:23:00.264 --> 00:23:01.804
Then what are you going to do?

283
00:23:02.205 --> 00:23:05.804
I'll give her a lot of cash for her wedding. She's in my team after all.

284
00:23:05.804 --> 00:23:07.975
What? So we're not hanging out on Christmas?

285
00:23:08.975 --> 00:23:10.115
We're going to.

286
00:23:10.244 --> 00:23:13.915
Is there a Christmas gift you want from me?

287
00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:16.814
- There isn't. - But there is one for me.

288
00:23:17.115 --> 00:23:18.155
What is it?

289
00:23:18.324 --> 00:23:20.685
- A handwritten letter. - A handwritten letter?

290
00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:24.994
A beautiful, handwritten letter you wrote with your heart.

291
00:23:26.794 --> 00:23:28.965
Well, that won't be hard.

292
00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:31.034
I can write you one right away.

293
00:23:31.135 --> 00:23:32.804
I'll write one right now.

294
00:23:34.504 --> 00:23:36.274
Hold on a second.

295
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:51.354
Merry Christmas. I appreciate your hard work.

296
00:23:57.665 --> 00:23:59.465
I'll put it in here.

297
00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:00.865
Read it later.

298
00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:06.405
My gosh. Is that a handwritten letter?

299
00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:08.104
I've never written one before.

300
00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:10.905
This is fun.

301
00:24:20.514 --> 00:24:22.455
Why did you come here?

302
00:24:22.655 --> 00:24:24.625
I'm going to sleep at my place today.

303
00:24:25.254 --> 00:24:26.324
Reum.

304
00:24:27.024 --> 00:24:28.324
You're so pretty.

305
00:24:31.465 --> 00:24:32.665
Which part?

306
00:24:32.965 --> 00:24:34.195
- Which part? - Yes.

307
00:24:34.534 --> 00:24:35.665
Go home.

308
00:24:43.205 --> 00:24:45.675
I'm not comfortable with you staying there. Go back to your mom's.

309
00:24:47.205 --> 00:24:48.475
What a cool guy.

310
00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:50.344
Stop playing, and get off now. Hurry.

311
00:24:51.044 --> 00:24:52.514
- Get off. - My goodness.

312
00:24:52.544 --> 00:24:54.385
You're scared of staying there too.

313
00:24:54.385 --> 00:24:56.084
When was I scared?

314
00:24:56.084 --> 00:24:58.254
- Close the door, and go inside. - No.

315
00:25:11.534 --> 00:25:12.665
Gosh, you scared me.

316
00:25:12.665 --> 00:25:14.534
Why would your own mother scare you?

317
00:25:15.135 --> 00:25:16.475
Are you feeling guilty or something?

318
00:25:17.534 --> 00:25:18.675
Not at all.

319
00:25:19.804 --> 00:25:20.945
Who was that?

320
00:25:22.274 --> 00:25:25.814
- What do you mean? - The guy you were with downstairs.

321
00:25:29.054 --> 00:25:30.115
My boyfriend.

322
00:25:30.485 --> 00:25:32.284
What? Your boyfriend?

323
00:25:32.284 --> 00:25:34.494
My gosh. Hey, you. Sit down.

324
00:25:34.494 --> 00:25:35.594
What?

325
00:25:36.695 --> 00:25:37.725
What does he do?

326
00:25:38.594 --> 00:25:39.665
He's a doctor.

327
00:25:41.334 --> 00:25:42.635
A doctor?

328
00:25:42.764 --> 00:25:45.004
- How old is he? - We're the same age.

329
00:25:45.004 --> 00:25:47.064
- Where does he live? - I don't know.

330
00:25:47.064 --> 00:25:48.735
- Where did he go to school? - I don't know.

331
00:25:48.735 --> 00:25:50.635
How about his family? How many siblings does he have?

332
00:25:50.635 --> 00:25:53.705
Are his parents alive? What do they do?

333
00:25:53.705 --> 00:25:56.175
I don't know. I didn't ask.

334
00:25:56.175 --> 00:25:57.915
What? You're unbelievable.

335
00:25:57.915 --> 00:26:00.284
Think about your age. How could you not ask him those questions?

336
00:26:00.284 --> 00:26:02.915
These days, whether it's fate or not,

337
00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:06.084
every relationship is built on qualifications.

338
00:26:06.324 --> 00:26:08.254
You must check thoroughly from A to Z.

339
00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:10.254
That's how you'll know whether to marry or break up with him.

340
00:26:12.264 --> 00:26:13.294
Marry him?

341
00:26:16.635 --> 00:26:20.764
When did you decide that you were going to marry Dad?

342
00:26:20.764 --> 00:26:24.104
I decided to get married...

343
00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:25.205
When?

344
00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:28.344
When I was a little out of my mind?

345
00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:42.554
If it's too complicated, think about it tomorrow.

346
00:26:45.564 --> 00:26:46.824
Tomorrow,

347
00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:50.695
it will all be fine.

348
00:27:22.465 --> 00:27:23.695
Sir.

349
00:27:30.104 --> 00:27:32.104
I have something to tell you.

350
00:28:00.965 --> 00:28:04.975
Someone will visit tomorrow to check the boilers. Don't forget.

351
00:28:05.074 --> 00:28:07.875
We need them checked before it gets too cold.

352
00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:09.814
If you just leave them, it could cause trouble.

353
00:28:09.814 --> 00:28:12.485
And I took your parka to the laundry.

354
00:28:12.485 --> 00:28:15.054
Don't forget to bring it.

355
00:28:15.054 --> 00:28:17.784
There is bulgogi on the frying pan ready to be cooked.

356
00:28:17.784 --> 00:28:20.385
I'll wash white clothes with only a little bit of detergent.

357
00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:22.455
That's how you wash them clean.

358
00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:24.794
You're not going far away.

359
00:28:25.195 --> 00:28:27.524
If I leave home for just a while,

360
00:28:27.524 --> 00:28:29.334
it becomes a pigsty.

361
00:28:29.534 --> 00:28:32.705
Gosh, you only know how to make a mess...

362
00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:34.034
and not how to clean them up.

363
00:28:34.034 --> 00:28:36.875
Don't worry. You should go to the hospital and take a rest.

364
00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:38.945
- Think of this as a vacation. - All right.

365
00:28:39.344 --> 00:28:42.514
You're the only one who cares for me.

366
00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:45.744
And by the way,

367
00:28:45.744 --> 00:28:48.685
after I go into surgery tomorrow, don't starve.

368
00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.385
Have breakfast, all right?

369
00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:53.054
There's a restaurant that makes good hangover soup.

370
00:28:53.054 --> 00:28:55.494
Gosh, don't worry about me.

371
00:28:55.925 --> 00:28:57.625
I'll take you to the hospital.

372
00:28:57.625 --> 00:28:59.725
You should leave early to avoid rush hour.

373
00:28:59.725 --> 00:29:03.195
No, it's fine. You should go to work.

374
00:29:03.534 --> 00:29:06.665
You're a busy man. Don't mind me. It's fine.

375
00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:08.834
That'll make me feel better.

376
00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:10.334
Don't.

377
00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:12.844
Don't treat me like I have a serious disease.

378
00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:15.915
She'll get well soon.

379
00:29:16.615 --> 00:29:18.844
You need to do something with me after you eat.

380
00:29:30.655 --> 00:29:33.324
- Don't put it over here. - Gosh.

381
00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:38.264
- Did you wash? - What?

382
00:29:43.604 --> 00:29:46.004
I'll do the rest. You should go upstairs first.

383
00:29:46.344 --> 00:29:47.445
- Really? - Yes.

384
00:29:48.215 --> 00:29:49.445
All right.

385
00:30:00.054 --> 00:30:01.254
Stop.

386
00:30:02.955 --> 00:30:05.064
- Mom, I'm going. - Okay.

387
00:30:17.604 --> 00:30:21.244
Oh, my. They're all clean now.

388
00:30:21.244 --> 00:30:23.215
You're always doing the hard work.

389
00:30:23.215 --> 00:30:24.945
It's nothing.

390
00:30:24.945 --> 00:30:28.354
I had to do something after eating such a delicious meal.

391
00:30:28.354 --> 00:30:31.354
I know you're flattering me, but it feels nice.

392
00:30:31.354 --> 00:30:34.324
- It isn't just flattery. Thank you. - All right.

393
00:30:42.735 --> 00:30:43.935
Oh, my.

394
00:30:45.764 --> 00:30:48.004
Hey! Hey!

395
00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:05.254
I knew it.

396
00:31:06.278 --> 00:31:08.678
(Episode 28 will air shortly.)
