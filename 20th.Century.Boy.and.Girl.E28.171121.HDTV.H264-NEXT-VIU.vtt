00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:08.865
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.795
I knew it.

3
00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.805
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.775
- I didn't know you came over. - We did.

5
00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:27.475
What is it, Dad? I thought you were going out. You didn't leave yet?

6
00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:29.345
I'm on my way out.

7
00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.525
Mom's surgery is tomorrow. Come home early, and don't drink.

8
00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:35.885
I got it.

9
00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.424
Then have fun.

10
00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:39.695
- We will. Bye. - Okay.

11
00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.534
One ticket to Hadong, please.

12
00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:51.775
When would you like to depart?

13
00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:53.504
The fastest one will do.

14
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.224
(75-16 Seochang-myun, Hadong-gun, Gyeongsang Province)

15
00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:05.845
Jin Jin, you are in a bad mood after meeting your older sister.

16
00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:07.114
Gosh, I'm tired.

17
00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:08.914
This feels nice.

18
00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:12.454
But consider her lucky.

19
00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:15.254
I rolled her in a blanket, you guys came over to hang out,

20
00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:18.055
and brought her snacks to make her feel better.

21
00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:21.895
I do feel better.

22
00:02:22.065 --> 00:02:24.395
Is your older sister still scary?

23
00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:25.634
No, she's not.

24
00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:29.305
Hey, even though you'd argue with your sister,

25
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:33.234
you'd copy her. You liked Anthony and books that your sister liked.

26
00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:34.845
You even wore her clothes too.

27
00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:37.145
Your sister was your role model.

28
00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:40.074
She's right. You like cosmos because of your sister.

29
00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.145
She liked everything that I liked.

30
00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.685
No, you liked everything she liked.

31
00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:03.164
Are you waiting for the right timing by wasting your time?

32
00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:13.074
It was too short of my time to waste.

33
00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:18.185
Do you truly enjoy fishing?

34
00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:19.254
Yes.

35
00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:26.025
You're neither Socrates nor Plato.

36
00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:27.865
Stop thinking.

37
00:03:28.764 --> 00:03:29.895
I should, right?

38
00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:34.234
I like the silence.

39
00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:37.704
Don't you think I might've gotten into the wrong profession?

40
00:03:38.104 --> 00:03:39.974
Why are we talking about your job now?

41
00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:43.444
Jeong Eun.

42
00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:45.315
Yes?

43
00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:48.085
Let's stop here.

44
00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:52.284
I'm saying that we should part ways.

45
00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:53.854
I think...

46
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.655
this is where my acting career ends.

47
00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:01.395
Given your competency,

48
00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:04.395
you could do so well as a great actor's manager.

49
00:04:05.134 --> 00:04:07.065
Print a set of decent business cards,

50
00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:10.305
and work behind a big desk while sitting on a big chair.

51
00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.474
You wouldn't have to...

52
00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:15.204
drive me all over the place.

53
00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:18.675
I have no desire, ambition,

54
00:04:18.915 --> 00:04:20.444
or ability.

55
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:24.355
I think it's right that...

56
00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:26.815
we part ways.

57
00:04:27.454 --> 00:04:28.985
You idiot.

58
00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:31.495
You should scream at me.

59
00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:33.824
"Why can't you get me any meaty roles?"

60
00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:36.194
"Why are you embarrassing me?"

61
00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:38.295
You should take your anger out on me.

62
00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:39.565
That's what others do.

63
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:42.665
Whether they're famous or not, they blame their managers.

64
00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.774
That's what I'm here for.

65
00:04:45.904 --> 00:04:48.375
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

66
00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:51.315
I'm tired.

67
00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.815
You'll really regret this.

68
00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.954
We survived all the rocky and muddy roads.

69
00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:01.154
There will be an end to this one too. Okay?

70
00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:05.094
Forget about those roads.

71
00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:08.225
Find a paved one.

72
00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:11.935
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

73
00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:16.065
Fine, let's quit.

74
00:05:16.964 --> 00:05:20.204
- Sorry. - After just one more drama.

75
00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:24.105
It's our retirement fund.

76
00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:28.944
Consider it a retirement fund for working for 20 years.

77
00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:32.115
Think about it just once more.

78
00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:21.504
Daughter.

79
00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:26.735
Next time, let's eat it while it's still hot.

80
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.464
(Moisturizing cream)

81
00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:58.834
(Cream, oil, essence, toner, eye cream)

82
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.745
My sweet child.

83
00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:11.185
She's all grown up.

84
00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.615
All grown up.

85
00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:19.725
She should've grown up slowly.

86
00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:23.694
She should've taken her time.

87
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:46.384
Isn't this from yesterday?

88
00:07:46.384 --> 00:07:48.355
I'm out of soup ingredients.

89
00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:50.894
Why are you always out of everything?

90
00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:53.355
There's no stew and nothing to sink my teeth into.

91
00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:56.995
All I have is a small bowl of soup.

92
00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.964
- I can't eat with this. - I'm leaving.

93
00:07:59.964 --> 00:08:00.964
Wait.

94
00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:05.175
- Take these lunches I packed. - Forget it.

95
00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:08.605
I packed all the food I cooked instead of giving your dad some.

96
00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:11.175
Give one to your teacher.

97
00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:13.844
He's a senior lawyer.

98
00:08:14.415 --> 00:08:15.844
I don't know better.

99
00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:18.855
Don't pack our lunches. We can eat out.

100
00:08:21.154 --> 00:08:23.454
(Hospital)

101
00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:34.964
Mom.

102
00:08:35.104 --> 00:08:38.974
Min Ho, I'm not going in to die.

103
00:08:40.204 --> 00:08:44.045
My baby. I won't be long.

104
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.545
- See you later. - See you.

105
00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:49.145
See you soon.

106
00:08:49.344 --> 00:08:50.714
Mom.

107
00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.454
(Operation Room)

108
00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:00.354
Are you a kid?

109
00:09:02.094 --> 00:09:03.324
Stop crying.

110
00:09:04.464 --> 00:09:09.935
(Kim Mi Kyung, Aged 64, In surgery)

111
00:09:09.935 --> 00:09:14.244
(Operation Room)

112
00:09:15.074 --> 00:09:17.145
You're still a baby.

113
00:09:17.175 --> 00:09:19.574
Goodness, stop crying, okay?

114
00:09:29.354 --> 00:09:31.694
I prayed from the top of the sky...

115
00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:34.055
for your mom's surgery to go well.

116
00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:36.694
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

117
00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:38.765
My prayers always work.

118
00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:40.864
Sa Jin Jin, be courageous.

119
00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:42.704
The surgery will go smoothly.

120
00:09:43.334 --> 00:09:45.775
Jin Jin, I'll come over later.

121
00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:47.135
Be strong.

122
00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:07.055
Dad.

123
00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:12.864
Look at me if you feel worried.

124
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:15.864
Okay.

125
00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:21.374
Don't wait.

126
00:10:21.805 --> 00:10:24.315
I'm not waiting for anyone.

127
00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:35.324
Shall I make cup noodles?

128
00:10:35.324 --> 00:10:38.194
We can't do that when we have such a feast.

129
00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:40.694
It looks so good.

130
00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:47.035
Just a moment.

131
00:10:52.474 --> 00:10:54.805
Lawyer Kang Kyung Seok's office.

132
00:10:57.645 --> 00:11:01.785
The police just arrested the real estate conman.

133
00:11:01.785 --> 00:11:03.614
I have to go to the police station.

134
00:11:05.114 --> 00:11:07.415
You weren't able to eat.

135
00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:10.385
I'll eat when I get back. Enjoy the food.

136
00:11:10.385 --> 00:11:11.494
Thank you.

137
00:11:13.824 --> 00:11:15.525
The surgery went well.

138
00:11:15.525 --> 00:11:19.734
She might feel some pain today, so I prescribed painkillers.

139
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:22.864
I operated on her right eye,

140
00:11:22.864 --> 00:11:25.935
but overusing her left eye could cause strain,

141
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.074
so we covered both eyes up.

142
00:11:28.474 --> 00:11:31.515
I know it'll be uncomfortable, but try to get by for a week.

143
00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:32.874
Okay.

144
00:11:33.114 --> 00:11:35.614
- Thank you. - Thank you.

145
00:11:36.415 --> 00:11:38.484
Jin Jin, I'm a huge fan.

146
00:11:39.354 --> 00:11:40.415
Thank you.

147
00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:42.425
- Thank you. - Thank you.

148
00:11:46.494 --> 00:11:49.594
The three of you thanked him in unison.

149
00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:51.265
Mom.

150
00:11:52.565 --> 00:11:54.665
Do you really not see me?

151
00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:58.734
- How can I not see you? - You see me?

152
00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:01.244
I see both of you.

153
00:12:01.374 --> 00:12:03.175
I gave birth to you.

154
00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:05.344
How could I not see you even with my eyes covered?

155
00:12:05.344 --> 00:12:08.214
- Do you see me too? - Of course. I see all of you.

156
00:12:08.214 --> 00:12:10.885
I can even see you getting into trouble.

157
00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:14.655
You don't see a thing. You're so wrong.

158
00:12:14.655 --> 00:12:16.385
You're lying.

159
00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:21.065
Why are you acting like a child when I'm the one in bed?

160
00:12:21.065 --> 00:12:23.194
- I don't know. - Dad.

161
00:12:23.964 --> 00:12:25.065
Dad.

162
00:12:25.964 --> 00:12:29.364
What are you looking at? Look at me, okay?

163
00:12:41.045 --> 00:12:43.244
I was going to sleep here with Mom.

164
00:12:43.344 --> 00:12:45.584
Stop giving her a headache.

165
00:12:45.584 --> 00:12:48.324
You're too noisy. Let's let her rest.

166
00:12:48.324 --> 00:12:51.454
- Mom, can I really go? - Yes, go.

167
00:12:51.454 --> 00:12:54.464
- Why? - I prefer having a daughter.

168
00:12:54.464 --> 00:12:58.035
She's useless. She can't do anything.

169
00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:00.734
I have a bad feeling about this.

170
00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:02.165
- I'll call. - Bye.

171
00:13:02.165 --> 00:13:03.334
Bye.

172
00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:34.265
Mom, open wide.

173
00:13:34.364 --> 00:13:38.035
Here, have some rice.

174
00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:41.374
- Is it not too hot? - No.

175
00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:45.275
Ji Won's mom, Dad's sister in Gyeongju,

176
00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:49.015
your sister in Pyeongtaek, and the rest is all Dad.

177
00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:52.785
Is there anything else from an unknown number?

178
00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:55.084
- No. - Any text messages?

179
00:13:56.785 --> 00:13:59.795
The supermarket's having a 30-percent sale.

180
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:03.025
"Seafood, fruit and vegetables, and dairy an extra 20 percent off."

181
00:14:03.124 --> 00:14:06.565
They only have this sale once a month, and I'm missing it.

182
00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:07.635
Shall I go?

183
00:14:08.104 --> 00:14:09.204
Will you?

184
00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:13.905
It's so cold. I'm freezing.

185
00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:19.645
"Suwon Courthouse"?

186
00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:21.114
Gone to Suwon Courthouse.

187
00:14:24.484 --> 00:14:25.785
Thank you.

188
00:14:25.984 --> 00:14:28.224
Thank you for the food.

189
00:14:29.984 --> 00:14:31.124
I'm starving.

190
00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:46.234
It's so salty.

191
00:14:59.854 --> 00:15:01.454
It's way too salty.

192
00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:07.124
You just started?

193
00:15:11.834 --> 00:15:14.204
Ever since my mom became menopausal,

194
00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:17.435
she's had a hard time seasoning food properly.

195
00:15:17.435 --> 00:15:20.405
I think today was one of her bad days.

196
00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:22.074
I enjoyed the food.

197
00:15:22.344 --> 00:15:24.315
Really? It wasn't too salty?

198
00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:26.015
I don't know much about taste.

199
00:15:26.244 --> 00:15:27.714
I eat what I'm given.

200
00:15:29.484 --> 00:15:30.584
That's great.

201
00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:35.185
- Send the client the paperwork. - Okay.

202
00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:37.655
Do you have the data on the childcare expense case?

203
00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:39.025
Yes.

204
00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:49.065
Mom, I'll go to the convenience store.

205
00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:50.834
To get wet wipes and a toothbrush.

206
00:15:50.874 --> 00:15:53.305
- Do you need anything? - No.

207
00:15:53.775 --> 00:15:55.405
Can you go on your own?

208
00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:57.714
Can you manage on your own?

209
00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.645
I'll just sit still.

210
00:16:00.214 --> 00:16:01.484
Take care.

211
00:16:01.484 --> 00:16:03.685
- See you in a bit. - Okay.

212
00:16:03.685 --> 00:16:04.885
I won't be long.

213
00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:12.055
Isn't that Sa Jin Jin? It is.

214
00:16:12.295 --> 00:16:13.694
Why is she here?

215
00:16:13.795 --> 00:16:15.824
- That's 8 dollars and 40 cents. - Okay.

216
00:16:21.604 --> 00:16:25.135
Sorry, I forgot my wallet. I'll come right back.

217
00:16:25.135 --> 00:16:26.405
Okay.

218
00:16:41.824 --> 00:16:44.854
Jin Jin, can you get me a glass of water?

219
00:16:56.878 --> 00:17:00.110

220
00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:12.555
Ho Sung.

221
00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:19.124
My Ho Sung's here.

222
00:17:24.394 --> 00:17:25.495
Ho Sung.

223
00:17:26.995 --> 00:17:29.505
Answer me, Ho Sung.

224
00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:41.914
Mom.

225
00:17:50.184 --> 00:17:51.324
Ho Sung.

226
00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:53.255
Did you eat?

227
00:17:54.124 --> 00:17:55.525
Are you hungry?

228
00:17:56.364 --> 00:17:59.995
I can't cook for you because of the state I'm in.

229
00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:01.934
You poor thing.

230
00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:09.904
I'm fine. My surgery went well.

231
00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:12.515
Don't worry about me.

232
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.045
Oh dear.

233
00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:18.584
My sweet child.

234
00:18:21.424 --> 00:18:23.785
I wish I could see you.

235
00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:39.934
It's okay, it's okay.

236
00:18:42.344 --> 00:18:43.545
It's okay.

237
00:19:50.705 --> 00:19:54.215
You should've brought the co-pilot with you.

238
00:19:55.114 --> 00:19:56.785
I wanted to surprise him.

239
00:19:57.445 --> 00:19:59.055
He'd get bored if he saw me now.

240
00:19:59.555 --> 00:20:01.324
Men can't be bothered.

241
00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:04.084
That's true.

242
00:20:27.144 --> 00:20:28.245
You're beautiful.

243
00:20:28.414 --> 00:20:29.614
I feel so embarrassed.

244
00:20:36.824 --> 00:20:38.025
How do I look?

245
00:20:38.455 --> 00:20:39.755
Do you see my bump?

246
00:20:40.624 --> 00:20:41.924
Is it too tight?

247
00:20:44.495 --> 00:20:45.834
I feel so embarrassed.

248
00:20:54.104 --> 00:20:55.805
- What's wrong? - What?

249
00:20:57.205 --> 00:20:58.245
It's nothing.

250
00:20:59.414 --> 00:21:00.715
It's not nothing.

251
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.884
You look like you want to poop.

252
00:21:02.884 --> 00:21:06.114
Don't say that. Don't talk about poo.

253
00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:11.894
The spicy octopus must be writhing inside you.

254
00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:13.094
Stop the car.

255
00:21:13.894 --> 00:21:16.864
- I'm fine. - Stop the car. Go to a toilet.

256
00:21:16.965 --> 00:21:18.995
No, I'm fine.

257
00:21:18.995 --> 00:21:20.695
- Can you hold it in? - Yes.

258
00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:22.434
What? Yes, yes.

259
00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:24.205
No, yes, maybe.

260
00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:27.945
It's not critical yet, is it?

261
00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.344
Reum.

262
00:21:32.775 --> 00:21:34.584
I think I'm about to die.

263
00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:36.315
What are you going to do?

264
00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:39.055
Stop the car, and run into a bush.

265
00:21:39.055 --> 00:21:41.624
No, no, no, I...

266
00:21:41.824 --> 00:21:45.025
I... I can... I can only poop in my bathroom.

267
00:21:45.255 --> 00:21:46.555
Not anywhere else.

268
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:49.725
- What? - I can only poop in my bathroom.

269
00:22:05.114 --> 00:22:07.344
(Merry Christmas. Keep up the good work. Ah Reum.)

270
00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:24.265
I decided to get married...

271
00:22:24.965 --> 00:22:28.164
when I slightly lost my mind.

272
00:22:35.975 --> 00:22:37.344
Ji Won.

273
00:22:38.874 --> 00:22:40.515
I found Love Cosmos.

274
00:22:40.515 --> 00:22:42.515
- Her name is Sa Ho Sung, yes. - Sa Ho Sung?

275
00:22:42.815 --> 00:22:43.945
Sa Ho Sung.

276
00:22:44.015 --> 00:22:45.384
Try harder next time.

277
00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:48.884
- Ji Won. - What?

278
00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:51.055
It's nothing.

279
00:22:51.824 --> 00:22:53.555
Do you want to see Mi Dal?

280
00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:54.965
Not at all.

281
00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:56.525
What do you mean?

282
00:22:57.695 --> 00:22:58.695
Yes.

283
00:22:59.894 --> 00:23:00.965
"Yes"?

284
00:23:01.104 --> 00:23:03.634
You know, if you ever get bored of being alone...

285
00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:12.344
I feel so refreshed. Why did I wait so long?

286
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.245
You should be careful.

287
00:23:15.515 --> 00:23:18.285
Don't let any water get into your eyes.

288
00:23:19.055 --> 00:23:20.584
Get me the hair dryer.

289
00:23:21.255 --> 00:23:22.424
Where is it?

290
00:23:25.255 --> 00:23:26.894
It pays to live long.

291
00:23:27.094 --> 00:23:28.795
What a luxury this is.

292
00:23:35.434 --> 00:23:36.604
Hello?

293
00:23:38.975 --> 00:23:40.035
Hello?

294
00:23:43.104 --> 00:23:44.315
Ho Sung.

295
00:23:46.574 --> 00:23:47.684
Ho Sung?

296
00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:55.455
Yes, Mom.

297
00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:57.824
Hello, my daughter.

298
00:23:59.124 --> 00:24:00.354
Did you eat dinner?

299
00:24:01.725 --> 00:24:02.965
Yes, I did.

300
00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:05.195
What about you?

301
00:24:05.934 --> 00:24:09.735
- How are you feeling? - I'm fine. I'm all better now.

302
00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:13.134
I just washed my hair too. What about you?

303
00:24:13.674 --> 00:24:15.604
What did you eat for dinner?

304
00:24:16.674 --> 00:24:18.815
You should've eaten more.

305
00:24:19.644 --> 00:24:21.584
It got cold quickly.

306
00:24:21.584 --> 00:24:23.945
Boil barley tea to keep your body warm.

307
00:24:24.144 --> 00:24:26.584
You always have a cold in winter.

308
00:24:27.384 --> 00:24:29.584
Turn on the heating high.

309
00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:33.354
Okay. Yes.

310
00:24:39.495 --> 00:24:42.805
(My Cosmos, My Eternal Flower)

311
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:46.634
Ho Sung kept this all along.

312
00:24:53.344 --> 00:24:54.745
Ji Won.

313
00:24:55.384 --> 00:24:58.584
Do you know the very first flower the universe created?

314
00:25:00.924 --> 00:25:03.285
- Cosmos? - Yes.

315
00:25:04.725 --> 00:25:07.795
It's imperfect because it was the first flower to be created,

316
00:25:07.995 --> 00:25:09.795
but it's the most loved one.

317
00:25:10.424 --> 00:25:14.505
That's why she called herself my mom's cosmos.

318
00:25:17.104 --> 00:25:18.334
Jin Jin.

319
00:25:22.374 --> 00:25:24.574
Do you know what the meaning of cosmos is?

320
00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:28.545
Not just any meaning.

321
00:25:29.515 --> 00:25:31.255
The one your sister made.

322
00:25:36.184 --> 00:25:37.525
I love you.

323
00:26:10.725 --> 00:26:12.195
- Here you go. - Thanks.

324
00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:15.525
The meeting is next Monday.

325
00:26:15.525 --> 00:26:17.634
I'll be there for the fitting.

326
00:26:17.634 --> 00:26:20.094
The shoot will begin the week after on Wednesday.

327
00:26:20.094 --> 00:26:22.705
Mi Dal is going to call you personally regarding the outfits.

328
00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:26.634
Her hair is a problem. It needs to be braided and put in a bun.

329
00:26:26.634 --> 00:26:28.344
I already scheduled a meeting with hairstylists.

330
00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:30.775
But Jin Jin,

331
00:26:31.475 --> 00:26:34.515
when they asked you whom you liked more between the eldest son...

332
00:26:34.515 --> 00:26:36.644
of the powerful Minister of Justice and the bodyguard,

333
00:26:37.114 --> 00:26:40.015
- you said it was a secret. - I did.

334
00:26:40.114 --> 00:26:41.555
Who is it? Why is that a secret?

335
00:26:41.555 --> 00:26:43.555
I bet it's not that important.

336
00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:46.295
I gave you a clue. I'm devoted.

337
00:26:47.094 --> 00:26:50.765
Since the eldest son might be involved with a maid...

338
00:26:50.765 --> 00:26:52.834
I like the bodyguard more.

339
00:26:53.235 --> 00:26:54.864
Is that so?

340
00:26:55.705 --> 00:26:58.735
Hold on. It's about time the bodyguard showed up.

341
00:26:58.735 --> 00:26:59.874
What?

342
00:27:00.404 --> 00:27:02.404
- The bodyguard is coming. - He's coming here?

343
00:27:02.404 --> 00:27:03.404
Yes.

344
00:27:04.315 --> 00:27:05.644
Who is it?

345
00:27:06.515 --> 00:27:09.015
We should keep an eye on EW's new products.

346
00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:10.414
Please send a brief review...

347
00:27:10.414 --> 00:27:12.884
of the cosmetics markets' current files on stockholders.

348
00:27:12.884 --> 00:27:14.015
Yes, thank you.

349
00:27:16.824 --> 00:27:18.394
This is Gong Ji Won speaking.

350
00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.394
- Hello? - It's me.

351
00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:28.664
This is Bella.

352
00:27:30.934 --> 00:27:32.574
I'm in Korea.

353
00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.275
Let's meet.

354
00:27:37.975 --> 00:27:39.275
Here he comes.

355
00:27:54.025 --> 00:27:56.424
Hi. We look forward to working with you.

356
00:27:56.424 --> 00:27:59.265
All right. He's the new addition to our building and the bodyguard.

357
00:27:59.894 --> 00:28:01.035
Say hello.
