No!

7
00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.290
I said no! I won't go!

Find anything?

12
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.089
We couldn't find
any real leads yet.

13
00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:54.490
It looks like a rape and murder.

14
00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.259
One of her sneakers is missing.

15
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.660
Did you find anything nearby?

16
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.059
- No.
- Let's go in.

The case files
are the judges' lives,

21
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.630
so be careful with them.

22
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
I will.

23
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.540
You're volunteering?

24
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.840
Which high school?

25
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.139
Seojin High School.

26
00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.709
- I'll do the rest, so...
- I'll do it.

27
00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.380
It's my volunteer work,
so I should do it right.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.350
Thanks, Choi Jung Joo.

29
00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.100
You may go.

30
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.970
Okay.

31
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.400
Bye.

Hello?
Judge Yoo Myung Hee's chambers.

33
00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.549
Yes. Okay.

34

37
00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:55.569
Answer your phone.

38
00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:58.510
- It's so loud.
- I'm sorry.

39
00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:02.340
Hey.

40
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.780
Yes. I stayed up all night
doing a murder.

41
00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:11.890
The corpse was chopped up.

42
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.290
My entire body aches...

43
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.119
from doing the murder
all night long.

44
00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.960
Murders are a piece of cake now.

45
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.960
Now that murders grew on me,

46
00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.270
I can't do assaults anymore.

47
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.270
I'm going to do another murder.

48
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.970
A serial murder.

49
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.640
Next week, I need to do a rape too.

50
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.220
Rape just doesn't do it for me.

51
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.819
I prefer murder.

52
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.479
This is Lee Jung Joo.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

53
00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:16.879
Make an excuse for me to the chief.

54
00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.890
Say I went to the bathroom
because I'm constipated.

55
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.520
Hey, you! No!

56
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.559
Thief! No!

57
00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:59.059
Hey, you! Someone please stop
the guy on the bike!

58
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.229
My case file is in there!

59
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.770
Oh my gosh.

60
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.770
What's this?

61
00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.439
My case file is more precious
than my life!

62
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.479
Case file?

63
00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:38.270
Police?

64
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.700
Someone snatched my purse by
the station in front of the court.

65
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.840
Yes. Jongro, Seoul.

66
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.410
Yes.

67
00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:02.189
(My mom, Jang Soon Bok,
is innocent.)

68
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:04.390
(She is not a murderer.)

69
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.970
(Seoul Central District Court)

70
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.090
Who are you?

71
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.790
I need to return this shoe
to its rightful owner.

72
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.490
To do that, I need her bag.

73
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.589
Don't you try to get smart with me.

74
00:08:40.689 --> 00:08:43.559
If you return the bag now,
the punishment will be lenient.

75
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.669
- Hand it over.
- Get lost. Get away from me!

76
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.130
This becomes robbery
once weapons are involved.

77
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.870
Let's not take
this farther than larceny.

78
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:52.010
Don't you come near me!
Or I'll stab you.

79
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.280
You see,

80
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.150
if you injure me with that knife,

81
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.719
it's robbery with bodily injury. If
I die, it's robbery with homicide.

82
00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:07.819
Your sentencing won't
be lenient at all.

83
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.860
For your information,
with one punch to my cheek,

84
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.829
my teeth will fall out
since I'm very weak.

85
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.630
A brush of that knife might
kill me instantly.

86
00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:18.730
Do you want to spend years in prison
for stealing a handbag?

87
00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.400
- Don't come near me.
- He's right there!

88
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:25.069
Darn it.

89
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.630
I'm sorry.
I have chronic constipation.

90
00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:55.339
It's diarrhea.

91
00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:59.069
Diarrhea!

92
00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:01.280
I heard it was diarrhea.

93
00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:02.709
Was it constipation?

94
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.650
Well, I took too many pills
for constipation...

95
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.589
since I was very constipated,
and it caused diarrhea.

96
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.449
Diarrhea...

97
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.959
Let's say that you did have
diarrhea, but what time is it now?

98
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.599
We're going into trial soon.

99
00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:24.870
When will we have our meeting? When?

100
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.829
We can start now.

101
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.140
By the look of her, it seems
she had stayed up all night.

102
00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:31.709
She was probably reviewing...

103
00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:34.209
- Detective, did you find my purse?
- Jang Soon Bok's retrial.

104
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.939
I must find it.

105
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.380
- I have my documents...
- Judge Lee.

106
00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:40.010
Yes?

107
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.549
The grounds
of Jang Soon Bok's retrial is...

108
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.260
that Defendant Jang Soon Bok claims
her innocence and that she was...

109
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.130
threatened and coerced by the police
to make a false statement...

110
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.160
- as the police framed her.
- I didn't do it.

111
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.270
I'm right here, baby.

112
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.270
(Ministry of Justice)

113
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.140
She claims she confessed only
because his son committed murder.

114
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.980
I'm sorry.

115
00:11:10.579 --> 00:11:14.480
I won't make you worry anymore!

116
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.620
After finding out it wasn't him,

117
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.520
she recanted her confession.

118
00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:20.549
- She claimed her innocence then.
- Yong Soo!

119
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.860
Yong Soo!

120
00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:26.130
She wept and plead that
she wasn't the murderer,

121
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.459
- but the police imposed contrary.
- Young Joo.

122
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.230
She claims any evidence in favor of
her has been purposely disregarded.

123
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:36.169
The medical examiner's expert
opinion is that the skill...

124
00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:39.110
of chopping the corpse must be
of an experienced professional.

125
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.809
The polygraph result showed that
she didn't commit murder.

126
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.980
The police omitted these pieces
of evidence favoring her on purpose.

127
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.049
Those documents were indeed
submitted for the retrial.

128
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.490
However, it's not proven that
the police omitted...

129
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.189
the evidence deliberately.

130
00:11:53.189 --> 00:11:55.990
Her attorney resigned
after filing for retrial.

131
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.360
What do you think, Judge Lee?
You'll be writing the ruling.

132
00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:00.630
The fact that she has been
protesting her innocence...

133
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.059
for 10 years unswervingly makes me
rethink about rejecting her appeal.

134
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.329
She refuses to work in prison
as she's not guilty.

135
00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:09.469
She has a record
of fasting several times.

136
00:12:09.669 --> 00:12:11.669
In prison, she's known
to be a stubborn inmate.

137
00:12:12.569 --> 00:12:13.839
That's not true!

138
00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.510
Even her son is holding a protest
by himself in front of the court.

139
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280
I see your point.

140
00:12:18.849 --> 00:12:22.579
It's not easy to hold a protest
every day in rain or snow.

141
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.620
In the eyes of the law,

142
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.120
evidence proves the truth,
not one's claim.

143
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.020
I see that you have a direction
about this case.

144
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:33.030
Let's review her case file before
we come to our final decision.

145
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.130
Sorry? The case file?

146
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400
Yes.

147
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.069
Well...

148
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.709
I forgot them at home by accident.

149
00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:50.209
That's not to be forgotten.

150
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.349
What if something happens
to the file?

151
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.010
Will you take responsibility?

152
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.250
You should guard it with your life.

153
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.250
Unbelievable.

154
00:12:58.589 --> 00:12:59.650
Chief Oh,

155
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.990
- the trial is...
- My life depends on the documents.

156
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.660
You can take care of this, right?

157
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.390
(My life depends on the documents.)

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:45.799
(Unit 73 of Criminal Court)

165
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:56.079
Hello, this is Judge Sah Eui Hyun
of Unit 88 of Criminal Court.

166
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.709
I'd like to talk
to Judge Lee Jung Joo.

167
00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.650
She's in trial.

168
00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.719
This is Unit 73 of Criminal Court,
Seoul Central District Court.

169
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.449
The morning trial will convene.

170
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.959
Case number 2017G135.

171
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.520
The name of the defendant is
Kim Joo Hyung.

172
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.290
Is that right?

173
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.059
Yes.

174
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.160
Your date of birth is August 23,
1985.

175
00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:19.299
Is that right?

176
00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:21.000
Yes.

177
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.370
The information on your petition
is identical, isn't it?

178
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.569
(Jongro N2485, a man in 20s...)

179
00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:25.569
Yes, it is.

180
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.880
You have the right to refuse
to answer questions...

181
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.380
if they may incriminate you.

182
00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:34.750
The prosecution may proceed
with the indictment.

183
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:44.260
From 2016 to 2017,
Defendant Kim Joo Hyung has gone...

184
00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:46.290
around Seoul...

185
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.400
and metropolitan areas,
lured elementary schoolers,

186
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.329
and sexually assaulted them.

187
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.270
Therefore, for violating Protective
Code regarding minor sexual abuse,

188
00:14:56.469 --> 00:14:57.599
we'd like to prosecute him.

189
00:14:58.469 --> 00:15:01.209
Defendant Kim, did you receive
the copy of your indictment?

190
00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:04.480
Do you plead guilty on the charge
the prosecution brought upon?

191
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.949
Your Honor,

192
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.549
I did not sexually assault them.

193
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.449
I was only educating them.

194
00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:16.260
- You scumbag!
- What a piece of trash!

195
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.890
- Please keep it down.
- My baby.

196
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.530
That jerk.

197
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.500
I'm going to kill you!

198
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.599
- How could you live with yourself?
- My gosh.

199
00:15:24.599 --> 00:15:26.630
All right. Quiet, please.

200
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.829
- Keep it down, please.
- Scumbag.

201
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:28.939
I'm going to kill you.

202
00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:31.610
To experience once is
worth all the education.

203
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.439
- Defendant Kim, get a grip.
- Oh, no.

204
00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:38.380
How dare you speak such words?

205
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.010
Your Honor, you may not know this,

206
00:15:41.819 --> 00:15:43.719
but the youth likes it more
these days.

207
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.189
At first, they were crying
because they were scared,

208
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.459
but later on, they were enjoying it
more than me.

209
00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:50.120
Let go of me!

210
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.130
- You are a piece of trash!
- I can't believe this.

211
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.599
How dare you do that to my daughter?

212
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.969
All right. Quiet down, please.

213
00:15:58.099 --> 00:16:01.640
You should be thanking me for
teaching what schools don't teach.

214
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.099
You don't know anything
about your own daughters.

215
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:09.540
You're no better than trash.
You deserve to die!

216
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.589
Shut your mouth.

217
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.660
What? You were educating them?

218
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.059
Judge Lee.

219
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.400
My gosh, you look very sexy
when you're all riled up.

220
00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:33.469
I only work with minors
under 15 years of age.

221
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.299
It might be because of your robe,

222
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.709
but you're getting me quite excited.

223
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.010
That jerk. Today will be
your last day.

224
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:46.679
Someone like you doesn't
even deserve a trial.

225
00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.280
Hold on, Judge Lee.

226
00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.790
What are you doing? Get back down.

227
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.089
Let go of me.

228
00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:55.520
Didn't you hear what that scumbag
who's no better than dust said?

229
00:16:55.819 --> 00:16:57.760
How dare you belittle the court?

230
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.760
Chief Oh.

231
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.530
"Your Honor"?
You are full of yourself!

232
00:17:01.599 --> 00:17:02.699
What are you doing?

233
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:05.270
Don't you know what this outbreak
of yours will cause?

234
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.370
How could you do this
if you know that?

235
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.900
- Hey.
- Let go of me!

236
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.869
Judge Lee!

237
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.879
He deserves to be trampled
over like a maggot!

238
00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:20.480
- Judge Lee.
- Please stop.

239
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.780
He's the worst human being on Earth!

240
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.549
- Stop her!
- My goodness.

241
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:24.720
I said let go!

242
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.730
Listen to me, you son of...

243
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.760
You can't swear here.

244
00:17:37.129 --> 00:17:38.700
The courtroom is sacred.

245
00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:41.899
Judges are expected to hold dignity
in there.

246
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.740
The court adjourned because
a judge caused disturbance.

247
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:46.369
You'll be everyone's laughingstock.

248
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.180
How could a trial end in a chaos?
What did you say?

249
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.349
"He's no better than a maggot"?

250
00:17:52.349 --> 00:17:54.109
"Son of..."

251
00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:58.889
Are you a thug, Judge Lee?

252
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.690
I lost my senses when I heard him
say he was educating them.

253
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.290
Why did you take your robe off?

254
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.899
Don't you know you could have
lost your position as a judge?

255
00:18:08.099 --> 00:18:11.299
I worked so hard to get selected
as the exemplary unit.

256
00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:14.099
But whom was I kidding?
Exemplary, my foot.

257
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.000
We might be branded
as the troubling unit.

258
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.109
I don't think it'd go that far.
They would just keep an eye on us.

259
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.579
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680
What is it?

261
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.980
Well, I think you might want
to look at this.

262
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.089
What is it?

263
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.599
Look at this!

264
00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:45.670
It's all over the Internet.

265
00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:49.099
The number of views
is insanely high.

266
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.899
I'm terribly sorry.

267
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.339
I should've controlled my emotions.

268
00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:55.180
I was so upset about
losing my case file that...

269
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.379
What did you just say?

270
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.849
You lost your case file?

271
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:07.220
How?

272
00:19:08.389 --> 00:19:10.159
Someone stole my purse.

273
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.430
Your purse?

274
00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:13.690
Just slap me, why don't you?

275
00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.730
- Chief. Please...
- Oh, my gosh!

276
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.869
Don't you know
that if the case file gets lost,

277
00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:20.299
a guilty verdict...

278
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.639
can turn into a not-guilty verdict?

279
00:19:23.639 --> 00:19:26.569
I know that I must be prepared
to resign from the bench.

280
00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:27.839
Then how?

281
00:19:29.879 --> 00:19:32.010
So you're going to resign anyway.

282
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.349
That's why you went on a rampage
in the courtroom?

283
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.049
No, not at all.

284
00:19:36.879 --> 00:19:38.990
I worked hard to earn this robe.

285
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.089
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No!

286
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.059
No. Saying you're sorry
won't resolve anything.

287
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.500
What's your crime?
What is your crime?

288
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.500
You lost the case file.
You don't have it.

289
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.829
You can't find it anywhere!
It's gone!

290
00:19:53.829 --> 00:19:57.339
Then I'm going to just die on
the spot right there, so whatever.

291
00:19:57.339 --> 00:19:59.970
Do you get it or not? Do you or not?
Answer me.

292
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.280
That's it. That's it.
That's what it was. Right?

293
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.339
No!

294
00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:08.420
What despicable, little rat
took something so important?

295
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.559
Prosecution. Please make
your closing argument.

296
00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:55.329
(Jang Soon Bok's Trial for Theft)

297
00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:57.599
Defendant Jang Soon Bok,

298
00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:59.329
while serving her life sentence,

299
00:20:59.329 --> 00:21:01.470
rather than repent of her crimes,

300
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.809
didn't hesitate to steal
her fellow inmate's property.

301
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.109
I guess stealing property is nothing
after committing murder.

302
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.149
I, therefore, recommend
the defendant be fined...

303
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:15.220
2,999.90 dollars.

304
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.119
Defendant.
Make your closing argument.

305
00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:28.099
(My mom, Jang Soon Bok,
is innocent. She is not a murderer)

306
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040
Defendant.

307
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.109
Mom!

308
00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:52.889
Mom!

309
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.859
Yong Soo is here!

310
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.990
Yong Soo is here!

311
00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:04.629
Jang Soon Bok is not a murderer!

312
00:22:05.099 --> 00:22:08.799
Jang Soon Bok is innocent!

313
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.639
Mom, Yong Soo is here!

314
00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:14.809
Mom!

315
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.010
Mom! I missed you!

316
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.280
Mom!

317
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.250
Mom, Yong Soo is here!

318
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.319
I will pay for my crime...

319
00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:28.659
of stealing.

320
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.960
But I stole on purpose...

321
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.200
in order to be here today.

322
00:22:41.129 --> 00:22:42.240
Your Honor.

323
00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:46.369
Can you please record me...

324
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.839
with the security camera?

325
00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:54.250
Your Honor.

326
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.119
She says she'll accept
her punishment,

327
00:22:57.119 --> 00:23:00.690
but she wants to be filmed.
I question her intent.

328
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.760
Go ahead.

329
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.270
I did not kill my husband.

330
00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:22.010
I can swear...

331
00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:24.280
on my son's life.

332
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.780
Your Honor. This is irrelevant
to the present case.

333
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.849
I know that.

334
00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:34.960
That case is not under
this department...

335
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.960
I'm swearing on the life
of my child...

336
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.030
that I am innocent.

337
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.930
Would you be able to understand
how a mother would feel?

338
00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:47.170
I understand you requested
a new trial.

339
00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:52.369
My lawyer said
not to get my hopes up...

340
00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.639
and resigned.

341
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.839
- Your Honor...
- If you honor me, just listen.

342
00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:03.879
I'm not...

343
00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:06.589
trying to have hope.

344
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.389
I'm trying to remember...

345
00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:13.230
that I'm not a murderer.

346
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.200
After spending 10 years in prison,

347
00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:25.369
I'm starting to forget
that I didn't murder anyone.

348
00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:34.849
I get confused and wonder
if I actually killed my husband.

349
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.089
That...

350
00:24:41.089 --> 00:24:42.420
terrifies me.

351
00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:02.040
I must take this off now.

352
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.079
Defendant.

353
00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:07.809
For 10 years, I suffered injustice
and had to wear this.

354
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.920
I had to live as a murderer.

355
00:25:10.379 --> 00:25:11.819
- Your Honor.
- Put that back on her.

356
00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:14.790
I must not wear
this prisoner uniform anymore.

357
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.859
Because of your incorrect verdict,

358
00:25:18.329 --> 00:25:21.530
I was framed
and lived in pure torment.

359
00:25:22.629 --> 00:25:23.760
Why must I?

360
00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:27.329
Why are you doing this to me?

361
00:25:28.869 --> 00:25:30.970
What did my son do wrong?

362
00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:35.040
What did that good boy do wrong?

363
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.809
Why must he live
as a murderer's son?

364
00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:40.750
Why should my baby do so?

365
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:44.250
Why? Why? Let go!

366
00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:46.990
- Let go!
- We'll take a recess.

367
00:25:47.349 --> 00:25:48.619
Your Honor!

368
00:25:57.799 --> 00:25:59.730
That's enough. Thanks.

369
00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:07.139
That trial was over.
Why did you call recess?

370
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:09.780
I'm filling in for a prosecutor
away on his honeymoon.

371
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.879
Must I watch a thief put on a play?

372
00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:16.720
- Take the coffee, and go.
- Hey.

373
00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:21.520
I saw that since the trial.
What happened to your hair?

374
00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:23.889
That's gum. Let me see.

375
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.829
It's gum.

376
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.440
Fine. I'll go then.
I'll get out of your face.

377
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.210
At least tell me why.

378
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.980
Why are you suddenly
giving me the cold shoulder?

379
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.220
Isn't this Jung Joo's?

380
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.059
Your Honor. This is terrible.

381
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:08.339
(My innocence is your guilt.)

382
00:27:13.869 --> 00:27:15.079
What happened?

383
00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:18.250
She was shaking, saying
her blood sugar level was low,

384
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:23.579
so I rushed out to get juice
to bring her blood sugar level up.

385
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.520
I'm new, so I didn't know.

386
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:29.520
Oh no.

387
00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:33.559
It was while I stepped away
to use the restroom.

388
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.460
I'm sorry.

389
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.899
- Mr. Cha.
- Yes, Your Honor.

390
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.339
They think it's hypoglycemia.

391
00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:46.470
Okay. Call me when you get
to the hospital.

392
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.710
Okay.

393
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:54.950
Hey, seeing how she left that,

394
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.849
I can't not investigate.

395
00:27:56.849 --> 00:28:00.089
Why did you have to call recess?
This is such a pain.

396
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.589
Okay. We must preserve
the crime scene. Okay?

397
00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:06.960
"My innocence is your guilt." Wow.

398
00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:09.059
This line is more powerful than
"Wealth equals innocence,"

399
00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:10.829
"poverty equals guilt."

400
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:12.799
Do you want a copy?

401
00:28:23.409 --> 00:28:24.809
How did this happen?

402
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.619
This is Do Han Joon, a Seoul
District prosecutor.

403
00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.879
He's Assemblyman Do Jin Myung's son.

404
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:35.359
Please forget that I'm Assemblyman
Do Jin Myung's son.

405
00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:37.690
Remember as the vicious prosecutor
of Seoul Central District Court.

406
00:28:38.589 --> 00:28:41.399
Run a closed investigation
until you have definite answers.

407
00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:43.799
Sure, as long
as you're not soliciting me.

408
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.099
But I'm not sure if that will
keep the reporters at bay.

409
00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:49.700
We'll take care
of the correspondents.

410
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.409
Yes, I need you to come
to court immediately.

411
00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:56.540
We need to talk.

412
00:29:00.349 --> 00:29:03.049
If the media feeds
the public that...

413
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.589
she tried to prove her innocence
and correct an unfair ruling,

414
00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:10.059
regardless of facts,

415
00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:12.389
this will taint the reputation
of our courtroom.

416
00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:18.829
Chief Justice, to prepare ourselves,

417
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.839
we must dispose the video taken in
court during Jang Soon Bok's trial.

418
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740
Pardon?

419
00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:29.480
If the video gets leaked
and spreads on the Internet,

420
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.109
it may impose pressure on our court
including your justice panel...

421
00:29:33.109 --> 00:29:35.849
which will be in charge
of her retrial.

422
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.119
However, seeing how things
have panned out,

423
00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:40.389
we must consider her claim that...

424
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:43.119
The justice panel in charge will
review the case thoroughly.

425
00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:47.490
Unit 73 of Criminal Judicial Panel
consists of very competent judges.

426
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.760
Sir,

427
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.530
you must take a look at this.

428
00:30:02.809 --> 00:30:06.280
Try to understand
Chief Oh's disappointment.

429
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.950
He told us very clearly that...

430
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.750
he'd do nothing to risk
his chances of getting...

431
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.319
the judgeship at High Court.

432
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.420
But this outbreak happened.

433
00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:19.089
I know.

434
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.159
How could I not?
I tried to tag along...

435
00:30:23.159 --> 00:30:26.369
when he got his promotion
to High Court.

436
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.609
There's a video,
and I lost my case file.

437
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.180
I must find the documents first.
I'll be at the police station.

438
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.950
Judge Lee, what on earth
happened in the video?

439
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.920
One of the audience must have
recorded it and posted it online.

440
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.659
Shouldn't you try to take it down?

441
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.129
- Why did you lose your senses?
- Judge Lee.

442
00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:53.559
Are you all right?

443
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.399
How could she be?

444
00:30:56.559 --> 00:31:00.069
She can't be okay with this.
This is a huge problem.

445
00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:01.899
Come on, Judge Yoon.

446
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.139
How embarrassing.

447
00:31:04.139 --> 00:31:06.409
You just humiliated
the entire group of female judges.

448
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:07.440
She's right.

449
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:10.510
I don't know
why she'd bring gender into this,

450
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.680
but since I'm a chief judge without
a panel, I won't be humiliated.

451
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.049
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

452
00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:17.990
- Judge Lee will be okay, right?
- Judge Lee will be okay, right?

453
00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:26.290
You've gone mad! You must have.

454
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.359
You cursed, took off and threw
your robe in a courtroom.

455
00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:31.129
Why did you stop?
Why didn't you get naked and dance?

456
00:31:31.129 --> 00:31:32.770
Mom, this is considered an assault.

457
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:35.069
Fine, sue me. Do it.

458
00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:37.099
How are you going to handle
the video and the press?

459
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.839
"Dumb Judge", "Crazy Judge",
and "Angry Judge".

460
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:41.240
It's all over the Internet.

461
00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:43.109
Mom, do you need to scold me
just like everyone?

462
00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:46.809
I'm also about to go crazy
because of what I have done.

463
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.950
Don't you remember what you told me?

464
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.119
You said that you won't let
your sense of justice influence you.

465
00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:53.250
You said you'll be
a successful judge.

466
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.559
You said you'll make
your kids live in luxury.

467
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.530
Hold on.

468
00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:59.690
(Chief Justice)

469
00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:05.626
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)
