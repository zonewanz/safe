1
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.420
- Oh, my. - Oh gosh.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.920
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.290
- Oh, my. - Oh gosh.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.319
Can they do that in school?

5
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:14.890
Gosh.

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.060
Eun Ho.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.629
It's allowed?

8
00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:19.030
- Gosh. - No!

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.900
It was great.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.370
- Hello, Professor. - Hello.

11
00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:30.370
Hello everyone.

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.209
But why are you looking at me like that?

13
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.219
Is this your first time seeing a pretty girl kissing?

14
00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.049
- Yes, go and tell her off. - Don't pretend like you don't know.

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.260
- Stop pretending. - Why didn't you tell me?

16
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.530
I shouldn't have let you stay at my house.

17
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.859
Leave my house right away, scum.

18
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.060
It's not like that. It's...

19
00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.129
Wait.

20
00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:00.540
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.069
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

22
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.709
It's too tight.

23
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.680
- Gosh. - Gosh.

24
00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.319
What are you looking at?

25
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.819
- Girls, close your eyes. - Gosh, it's hot in here.

26
00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:18.819
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

27
00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:19.990
It's too hot in here.

28
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.030
What are you doing?

29
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.500
Don't look at her.

30
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.900
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

31
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.370
Did you know...

32
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240
that I am...

33
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.409
taeyang physiological type?

34
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.009
That's why I'm always hot.

35
00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.780
- Go away. - What? I don't want to.

36
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.919
- Let's go. - Isn't it hot in here?

37
00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.819
Is there anyone with the same physiological type?

38
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.439
She wasn't like this a few days ago.

39
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.949
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

40
00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:26.719
The genre changed.

41
00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.789
It was great.

42
00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.060
It's so different.

43
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.229
- Call me. - I can? I can?

44
00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.900
What was that? Do you know him?

45
00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.110
- No, I saw him for the first time. - What?

46
00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.969
He said he liked me and wanted my number.

47
00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.409
- You didn't give it to him, right? - I did. Why not?

48
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:48.680
Hey, how can you...

49
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.280
What? I can give my number to whomever I like.

50
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.780
Why are you doing this?

51
00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.819
Don't you really know...

52
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.120
why I'm doing this?

53
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.830
This is one of the three questions that men hate being asked.

54
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.099
Why are you doing this?

55
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.199
Don't you really know why I'm doing this?

56
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.129
Don't you really know what day it is?

57
00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.139
Don't you really know what you have done wrong?

58
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.069
- Do I need to tell you why? - Do I need to tell you why?

59
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.509
I didn't know I'd hear this from Ye Ri.

60
00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.509
Why now?

61
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.449
Go on. Answer me.

62
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.120
Calm down. I can do this.

63
00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.389
Think. Think. Think.

64
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.970
I know why you're doing this.

65
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.139
You do? What do you know?

66
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.279
You're angry because I didn't keep my promise.

67
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.879
I promised you that I won't tell anyone about us dating, but I did.

68
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.649
Do you really think that's why...

69
00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.920
But I did that on purpose.

70
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.649
- What? - People were watching,

71
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.389
and I didn't want to tell them that we weren't dating.

72
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.420
I wanted to tell them that you were mine.

73
00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.430
If I could, I want to tell everyone on earth...

74
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.029
that you are mine.

75
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.040
But I did break a promise. I'd like to apologize.

76
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.569
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.110
Look at him.

78
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.379
He's saying things that girls would love to hear.

79
00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.410
He's good.

80
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.680
Honesty is the solution in such situation.

81
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.220
Well done, Yoo Eun Ho. It's done.

82
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.319
All right. Apology accepted.

83
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.529
But you need to go somewhere with me.

84
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.959
Where?

85
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.860
You're as good as dead today.

86
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.410
It's so fun!

87
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.180
- Don't raise my arm! - I will!

88
00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.480
Don't. Don't!

89
00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.279
Guys, wasn't this fun?

90
00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.149
- Ye Ri wants to ride it again. - What?

91
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.959
Don't you want to go on the merry-go-round?

92
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.589
I thought you wanted to ride it.

93
00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.759
Merry-go-round?

94
00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.060
Why would I ride something like that?

95
00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.660
- I want to do this one again. - What?

96
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.899
- I want this one. - I'm screwed.

97
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Hurry. Hurry.

98
00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.540
We're going down!

99
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.980
It's cold!

100
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.350
It's so fun.

101
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.959
Where are you going?

102
00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:57.970
- I can't do this. - Let's go.

103
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.199
- We're going up the sky. - No.

104
00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.569
- Don't. - Yes!

105
00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:05.509
Hello.

106
00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.740
Help! Is anyone there?

107
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.410
- Gosh. - I love you, Eun Ho!

108
00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:18.720
This was so fun.

109
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.420
Let's do this one more time.

110
00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.259
- Come on. Gyro Swing is that way. - Okay.

111
00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:30.370
Okay. Okay.

112
00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.370
I'll make you get sick of me so that...

113
00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:37.839
you won't ever come near Ye Ri.

114
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.379
Let's go together.

115
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.850
Wait for me.

116
00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:14.839
It's nice.

117
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.879
It's been a while.

118
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.120
Why aren't you drinking?

119
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.519
I don't feel like eating right now.

120
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.389
Are you done being angry with me?

121
00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.389
Please forgive me.

122
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.560
Actually I'm not good with heights.

123
00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:35.769
I'll take pictures of you riding them instead.

124
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.330
This is weird.

125
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.700
He should be irritated by now.

126
00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:42.769
Is he stupid?

127
00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:45.909
By the way, you're eating a lot today.

128
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:47.379
Didn't you have breakfast today?

129
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:49.980
I got you.

130
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:53.049
What about it?

131
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.519
What? No, I wasn't saying it's bad.

132
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.590
Do you think it's weird? Why?

133
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.720
Now we've come to this.

134
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:03.830
There's an answer to this question.

135
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:06.730
I have to tell her what she wants to hear.

136
00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:09.799
If my hand wasn't injured, it would have been so easy.

137
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.899
Did Ye Ri used to ask such questions before?

138
00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:16.909
No, that's not what's important.

139
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.009
Think. Concentrate, Eun Ho.

140
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.409
You can do this.

141
00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:23.009
Think of all the cases and experiences you've had.

142
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.480
I think it's great that you're eating a lot. Eat up.

143
00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:29.789
I can't believe this.

144
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.659
Do you want me to eat this all and become fat?

145
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.929
If you eat too much, it's not good for your health.

146
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.259
Do you think I'm a pig?

147
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.830
So you want to say that I should stop eating?

148
00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:57.509
Answer the question. What's wrong with me eating?

149
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.019
Did you just laugh?

150
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:02.419
Did you laugh at me just now?

151
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.720
Stay still.

152
00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:29.309
Gosh, you had ketchup on your mouth.

153
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.950
Whether you eat a lot or not and even if there's food on your lips,

154
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.990
You look pretty no matter what.

155
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.590
So please, let's stop this.

156
00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:40.220
This is not like you.

157
00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:44.159
I need to go to the bathroom.

158
00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.659
Eat slowly.

159
00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:52.940
What is he?

160
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.539
How can he avoid all the wrong answers?

161
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.679
This won't work.

162
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.080
I need something big.

163
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.279
I need something big that will make him...

164
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.580
dislike Han Ye Ri.

165
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.919
Why isn't she coming back from the bathroom?

166
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.759
Yoo Eun Ho!

167
00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:18.360
I'm here!

168
00:10:24.429 --> 00:10:25.470
What...

169
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.850
Yoo Eun Ho!

170
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:49.830
What do you think? Does it look nice on me?

171
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.500
I must have eaten too much. It feels a little tight.

172
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.110
Are you drunk?

173
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:06.440
Where did you get this?

174
00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:12.220
My prince charming.

175
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.750
You should get dressed.

176
00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:16.289
Me?

177
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.259
Who took clothes number seven for the princess?

178
00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:29.830
Let it go. Let it go! Turn into ice.

179
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.899
You too, turn into ice!

180
00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:36.139
Why don't they?

181
00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:46.279
Why are you looking at me like that? Do I look weird?

182
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.580
No, it's pretty. It looks nice on you.

183
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.590
Are you sure?

184
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.389
You're not embarrassed of me?

185
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:55.590
No, you look like Elsa in a yellow dress.

186
00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:57.659
Let's go. I'll take a picture of you.

187
00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.470
He likes this?

188
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.370
Why would he like this?

189
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.070
Maybe...

190
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.039
he's a pervert.

191
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.279
I need to find out.

192
00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:14.210
Wait for me!

193
00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:17.480
(six dollars)

194
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.450
- Let me see. - Basic.

195
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.960
- Gosh. - Gosh.

196
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Gosh.

197
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:42.470
Hey.

198
00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:50.149
Don't lose this.

199
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.279
It looks so pretty.

200
00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:54.750
I'm going to stick them on my phone.

201
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.840
Why would he and Ye Ri...

202
00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:17.570
come here?

203
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.970
He wouldn't come looking at me now.

204
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.440
Now that I'm done with him, I should go back.

205
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.779
The parade will start in the square in a moment.

206
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.009
If you want to watch the parade,

207
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.879
come to the square by 6:30pm.

208
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.090
I should at least watch the parade.

209
00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:10.659
My stomach keeps hurting.

210
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.399
Where was the bathroom again?

211
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.830
Excuse me.

212
00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:16.570
Excuse me.

213
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.970
Princess number seven.

214
00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:21.500
Why aren't you on standby? It's nearly time.

215
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.110
What? Me?

216
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.169
Yes, you.

217
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.309
We've never met.

218
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.909
- Hurry. We're late. - Gosh.

219
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.649
- The number you have dialed... - Where did she go?

220
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.320
Seriously.

221
00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:53.200
Hello.

222
00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:18.230
Hello. Hello.

223
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.129
What are you doing there?

224
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.769
I had fun today.

225
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.669
Let's never meet again. Bye.

226
00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:27.370
Are you out of your mind? Come down.

227
00:15:27.669 --> 00:15:29.139
All right. Bye.

228
00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:32.240
Come down here.

229
00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.480
Bye. Bye.

230
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.279
Hey, you...

231
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:44.090
No, don't. Don't.

232
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.250
What's she doing?

233
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.190
- Oh, my. - What is she doing?

234
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.730
- Gosh. - Oh gosh.

235
00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:54.029
Mom, this princess...

236
00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:56.899
- threw up pizza. - Mom, she's a little strange.

237
00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:59.340
- Gosh. - She's not like a princess.

238
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.740
Gosh, I feel like throwing up.

239
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.870
- Gosh. - Oh gosh.

240
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.779
Mom, I don't like this.

241
00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:07.080
What's going on?

242
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.440
She's not pretty.

243
00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.079
Ye Ri.

244
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.480
Gosh. Hey.

245
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.519
Ye Ri, are you all right?

246
00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:17.690
Ye Ri.

247
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.359
What did I do yesterday?

248
00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.599
Is this real?

249
00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:21.819
Quietly.

250
00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:55.589
Gosh.

251
00:17:58.549 --> 00:18:00.759
How did you...

252
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.730
I know everything now.

253
00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:11.200
Is this your house?

254
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.670
Don't you remember what happened yesterday?

255
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.670
I don't. I don't remember anything.

256
00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:21.210
But why I am wearing this in his house?

257
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.549
This is...

258
00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:33.589
different, but good.

259
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.490
How do I look?

260
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.259
You look different and beautiful.

261
00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:42.529
How about me?

262
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.269
You look great in a uniform.

263
00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:54.380
It couldn't have been.

264
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.009
No.

265
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.710
I know...

266
00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.420
your secret.

267
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.720
What secret?

268
00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:05.960
I didn't know you'd have a different side to you.

269
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.559
How did you...

270
00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:10.130
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

271
00:19:10.589 --> 00:19:12.559
If I didn't, were you going to hide it forever?

272
00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:15.329
I...

273
00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:18.130
tried to tell you.

274
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.440
But I couldn't.

275
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.009
But you should have.

276
00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:25.809
If it was about something important like this, you should have.

277
00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:27.609
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.349
Just be careful.

279
00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:33.250
If you have a bad drinking habit, you shouldn't drink.

280
00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:37.619
- A bad drinking habit? - Do you feel better?

281
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.019
I bought some medicine. Do you want some?

282
00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:45.500
So you mean that I was drunk...

283
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.730
and acted weirdly?

284
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.069
Don't you remember what you did last night?

285
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:53.339
- Joo Seung. Joo Seung! - Gosh.

286
00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:54.940
Hurry.

287
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.309
Hey, what's this?

288
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.769
Isn't this Ye Ri?

289
00:19:57.769 --> 00:19:59.410
We can talk about this later.

290
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.779
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

291
00:20:01.839 --> 00:20:02.910
Gosh.

292
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.920
Gosh, she smells of alcohol.

293
00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:10.289
You should have taken her to her house. Why did you bring her here?

294
00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:13.190
Hey.

295
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:15.990
Help me take this off.

296
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:18.859
Gosh, this is stuffy.

297
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.529
This one. Yes, this one.

298
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:22.900
What are you doing?

299
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.930
She asked me to take this off.

300
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.740
Go and bring her Min Jung's clothes.

301
00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:29.140
- I'll take her clothes off first. - No.

302
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.210
- Gosh. - No.

303
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.539
No, no.

304
00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:35.609
No, the bathroom is that way.

305
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.880
- Gosh, the smell. - No.

306
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.819
She ate it back?

307
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.690
She ate it.

308
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.450
Gosh.

309
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.759
Hey!

310
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.289
More sea snails please.

311
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.660
You had sea snails?

312
00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:00.240
You scum.

313
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.869
How much did she drink? How can she throw up like this?

314
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.710
Don't make her drink so much.

315
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.279
And if you did, you should have solved it outside.

316
00:21:09.579 --> 00:21:11.349
Gosh the smell.

317
00:21:11.349 --> 00:21:12.549
Gosh.

318
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:15.390
Smell this, you scum.

319
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.450
Wait.

320
00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:19.490
There's a sea snail.

321
00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:22.130
- It's really big. - What?

322
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.890
What should I do?

323
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.130
- She thinks this is a sea snail. - What's going on?

324
00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:33.400
Min Jung.

325
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.869
What's... What's all this?

326
00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:41.180
Gosh!

327
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.750
Why did you make me do this in front of my sister?

328
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.910
Get up.

329
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.579
- Ye Ri. - Noodles are here too.

330
00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:49.089
You two...

331
00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:54.390
(Statement)

332
00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:58.190
You should be relieved that it didn't get any more serious.

333
00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.230
Dream World wanted to sue you for burglary.

334
00:22:03.329 --> 00:22:06.470
But Eun Ho begged them not to.

335
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.710
Dream World?

336
00:22:08.809 --> 00:22:11.269
They must have gone to Dream World.

337
00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:12.509
What is it?

338
00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:15.480
No, it's nothing.

339
00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:28.759
(Statement)

340
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.210
The whole school must know that we're dating now.

341
00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:45.710
Gosh, what should I do? It's driving me crazy.

342
00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:58.089
Did anything strange happen?

343
00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.720
No one is following you or bullying you?

344
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.029
I don't know. Why do you ask?

345
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.529
If you saw the face of the serial killer,

346
00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:10.829
he probably saw your face as well.

347
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:13.670
It feels weird that nothing has happened.

348
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.970
If nothing has happened, that's a good thing.

349
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.609
By the way, what happened to your hand?

350
00:23:20.609 --> 00:23:22.210
This?

351
00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:24.180
I touched something sharp.

352
00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:26.220
I see.

353
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.660
I remember her.

354
00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:35.829
No wonder she looked so familiar.

355
00:23:35.829 --> 00:23:37.789
It was her.

356
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.230
- Do you know her? - Yes.

357
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:45.269
It must have been three years ago.

358
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:48.940
A person has gone missing.

359
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.039
Something must have happened to him.

360
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.480
Please look for him.

361
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.309
- Wait. Wait. - Please.

362
00:23:59.049 --> 00:24:01.420
If you're not his family,

363
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.750
you can't report him missing.

364
00:24:04.089 --> 00:24:07.019
He's important as family to me.

365
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.230
Please. Please look for him.

366
00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:11.359
Please.

367
00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:18.500
Please. Please look for him.

368
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.640
Please. Please look for him.

369
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.839
Please. Please.

370
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.980
Please.

371
00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:33.180
She kept coming here looking for him for a while.

372
00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:36.319
I don't know if she's found him.

373
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.059
By the way, how do you know her?

374
00:24:40.859 --> 00:24:42.130
I'm her boyfriend.

375
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.400
I shouldn't have said it.

376
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.930
You should just pretend...

377
00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:53.700
not to know.

378
00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:56.269
It happened in the past.

379
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.849
How did he and Ye Ri...

380
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.420
Are you doing this because you think I might have been seeing him?

381
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.920
But I don't think...

382
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.660
I should let this one slide.

383
00:25:20.684 --> 00:25:25.684
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E05 Meloholic "The Secret Revealed"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

384
00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:33.009
- Did you have fun yesterday? - What?

385
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.549
Yesterday?

386
00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:38.619
Yes, it was fun.

387
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.319
It was nice to visit there again. It's been a while.

388
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.789
It's been...

389
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.589
five years.

390
00:25:48.259 --> 00:25:50.690
I've never been there.

391
00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:52.599
I see.

392
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.430
You said it was your first time yesterday, right?

393
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:57.230
Yes, it was my first time.

394
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.839
What did you enjoy the most?

395
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.940
Everything was fun.

396
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.380
It was my first time.

397
00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:09.210
It was your first time...

398
00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:11.250
so you liked everything?

399
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.349
Yes.

400
00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:19.289
Don't you have anything you want to tell me?

401
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.660
No.

402
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.660
Are you sure?

403
00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:46.779
Don't you have anything...

404
00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:48.819
you want to tell me?

405
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.460
This wasn't me.

406
00:26:58.059 --> 00:26:59.930
I didn't expect you to say that.

407
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.269
I thought you'd apologize...

408
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.099
or make excuses.

409
00:27:05.099 --> 00:27:06.140
It's true.

410
00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:08.339
This wasn't me.

411
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.210
I can explain...

412
00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.680
Don't lie to me.

413
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720
Please.

414
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.390
If you lie to me,

415
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.859
I have to see something that I don't want to see.

416
00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:36.799
- It's just that... It's... - All right.

417
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:39.369
Let's talk about this later.

418
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.390
So, what are you going to do?

419
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.119
- I don't know. - Why do you still have that?

420
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.660
You said you could take it off now.

421
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.990
I'm afraid.

422
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.460
I'm afraid of looking into her mind.

423
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.039
I'm afraid there may be something I shouldn't know about.

424
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.109
Maybe it's something you don't want to know.

425
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.779
You can be upset...

426
00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:21.839
after you find out the truth.

427
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.950
Why would you make a guess and be scared?

428
00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:26.150
Let's say she lied to you. So what?

429
00:28:26.619 --> 00:28:28.349
Have you always been truthful to her?

430
00:28:28.349 --> 00:28:30.950
Can you tell her everything about that hand?

431
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.519
You can't tell her that you can hear her thoughts when you hold her hand.

432
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.230
Everyone has their reasons.

433
00:28:46.069 --> 00:28:48.539
If she's hiding something,

434
00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:50.809
you need to wait until she can tell you the reason.

435
00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:54.440
And you'd know whether she's been...

436
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.009
sincere or not, right?

437
00:28:58.349 --> 00:28:59.480
Hello?

438
00:29:00.349 --> 00:29:01.420
What's the matter?

439
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.990
Min Jung?

440
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.190
I need to go.

441
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.190
She left school early?

442
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:10.029
Yes.

443
00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:18.640
Did anyone here ask for an inscription?

444
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.240
This is for Han Ye Ri.

445
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.779
- Yes. - Yes.

446
00:29:33.199 --> 00:29:35.040
Did anyone here ask for an inscription?

447
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:41.990
This is for Han Ye Ri.

448
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.529
- Yes. - Yes.

449
00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:47.500
Oh, my. You asked for the inscription under the same name.

450
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.299
This one is for Mr. Yoo Eun Ho.

451
00:29:50.869 --> 00:29:54.039
I have your product ready for you. Come this way to check it.

452
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.740
Wait a moment. Yours will be ready soon.

453
00:30:06.319 --> 00:30:08.190
Your girlfriend must have the same name as mine.

454
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.119
It's not a common name.

455
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.660
No, it's not.

456
00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:14.460
We've been dating for more than three years.

457
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.700
You've been seeing her for a long time.

458
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.829
Something came up, and we grew apart.

459
00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:22.099
But I want to make it work by giving her a ring.

460
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.369
She'll like it when I give it to her, right?

461
00:30:25.769 --> 00:30:27.210
Yes, probably.

462
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440
Bye.

463
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.599
What's going on? Is he off today?

464
00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:53.970
(Big Brother)

465
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.269
My teacher must have called him.

466
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.700
Gosh, I'm so dead.

467
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.509
What should I do? What should I do?

468
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.509
Min Jung.

469
00:31:04.009 --> 00:31:05.180
Hey!

470
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.880
I'm good at judging people.

471
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.789
I can feel what they're like with their first impression.

472
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:18.460
She seems like a vixen.

473
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.990
Gosh, Eun Ho doesn't know that.

474
00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:25.700
Everyone has two sides.

475
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.569
If you truly love someone, you should be able to embrace them.

476
00:31:31.339 --> 00:31:32.569
Like this story?

477
00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:34.809
It's just a novel.

478
00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:36.680
This doesn't happen in real life.

479
00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:41.210
Sometimes, what happens in real life may seem more unreal than a novel.

480
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.279
And stories may seem more real than reality.

481
00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:47.119
Oh, my.

482
00:31:55.259 --> 00:31:56.259
Are you all right?

483
00:31:58.829 --> 00:31:59.900
Yes.

484
00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:25.619
It's not here.

485
00:32:27.329 --> 00:32:28.890
Where could it be?

486
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.240
I can see everything.

487
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.509
I know who you are and

488
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:47.980
how honest and good you are.

489
00:32:48.309 --> 00:32:50.920
I'm so happy to have met someone like you.

490
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.130
It's true.

491
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.300
It wasn't me.

492
00:33:41.969 --> 00:33:43.230
I can explain...

493
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.460
I will tell you everything.

494
00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.969
But I need to tell you something before I start.

495
00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:50.670
I think I might have lost...

496
00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.239
the necklace you gave me.

497
00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:55.739
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:58.579
You lost the necklace?

499
00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:00.650
Maybe I didn't lose it.

500
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.119
She might have gotten rid of it on purpose.

501
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.750
In fact,

502
00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:08.719
the person that went to Dream World...

503
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:10.619
wasn't...

504
00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:17.530
You...

505
00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:19.360
had this?

506
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.639
Wait for me.

507
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.610
Hey, you left this.

508
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.860
Oh, my. It's broken.

509
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.059
I'll change the chain for you. I'll get the strongest one.

510
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.960
All right. Let's go.

511
00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:50.130
Where?

512
00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.829
You don't need to know. Let's go.

513
00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:56.570
After changing the chain,

514
00:35:57.239 --> 00:35:58.500
I've inscribed your initials.

515
00:35:59.739 --> 00:36:00.809
Don't you remember?

516
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.909
That is...

517
00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:09.010
Come to think of it, there have been so many strange things about this.

518
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.750
By the way, I've never been to Dream World.

519
00:36:13.949 --> 00:36:15.789
I want to go there...

520
00:36:15.949 --> 00:36:18.920
and ride the most boring rides.

521
00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:21.889
But it seemed like you've been there a lot.

522
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.329
Come on. The Gyro Swing is that way.

523
00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:27.030
Gosh.

524
00:36:34.369 --> 00:36:36.639
You seemed like a different person.

525
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.250
This...

526
00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:42.010
wasn't me.

527
00:36:44.179 --> 00:36:45.219
It's true.

528
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.190
It wasn't me.

529
00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.659
Tell me.

530
00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:53.789
What were you...

531
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.690
going to say?

532
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.559
Ye Ri.

533
00:37:42.809 --> 00:37:44.880
It's nice to see you again, Yoo Eun Ho.

534
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.449
Gosh, look at this.

535
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.690
She always wears dark and stuffy clothes.

536
00:37:56.889 --> 00:37:58.219
Gosh.

537
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.389
It's so stuffy.

538
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:02.260
Why do you like her?

539
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.400
Gosh, I can't understand you.

540
00:38:05.159 --> 00:38:06.199
Ye Ri.

541
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:08.199
Ye Ri is sleeping.

542
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.300
- What? - Ye Ri...

543
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.300
is sleeping up here.

544
00:38:13.769 --> 00:38:15.440
I told her to.

545
00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:18.679
This...

546
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.380
wasn't me.

547
00:38:22.449 --> 00:38:23.550
It's true.

548
00:38:24.179 --> 00:38:25.519
It wasn't me.

549
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.889
It can't be...

550
00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:31.989
Let go of me.

551
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.860
Let go.

552
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.730
I can't help it.

553
00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:41.000
Now that it's come to this, I need to see it for myself.

554
00:38:41.269 --> 00:38:42.269
What?

555
00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:48.039
Why would he and Ye Ri...

556
00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:50.139
come here?

557
00:39:02.789 --> 00:39:06.389
Now that I'm done with him, I should go back.

558
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.889
No, gosh.

559
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.099
1 plus 1 equals sea snail.

560
00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:19.039
2 plus 2 equals sea snail.

561
00:39:19.239 --> 00:39:22.539
- 3 plus 3 equals... - Sea snail.

562
00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.010
That's right.

563
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:29.480
Gosh.

564
00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:40.059
She's pretty.

565
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.960
Stop it.

566
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.599
Get out of the room now.

567
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.900
Wait, this is my room.

568
00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:48.530
- Get out. - Get out!

569
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.639
What if she throws up sea snail on the bed?

570
00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:53.510
- Get outside! - Be quiet.

571
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.769
- Get outside! - I'm sorry.

572
00:39:55.769 --> 00:39:58.110
Get outside. I can't bear this.

573
00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.239
Good night.

574
00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:01.349
Stop it. It smells, you scum.

575
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.090
When she finds out where she is in the morning,

576
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.000
she'll be really surprised.

577
00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:26.269
I'm going to sleep like Elsa in a yellow dress.

578
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.550
My job is done.

579
00:41:02.369 --> 00:41:03.440
Hey.

580
00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:05.239
Wake up.

581
00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:08.079
Were you surprised?

582
00:41:10.949 --> 00:41:13.519
I guess that's natural.

583
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.860
So, that wasn't...

584
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.329
Ye Ri?

585
00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:33.539
Now you're thinking straight.

586
00:41:33.969 --> 00:41:36.170
- I thought you were too stupid. - Wait.

587
00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.909
That means...

588
00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:43.050
Are you going out with Byung Cheol?

589
00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:45.119
No.

590
00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:46.789
No.

591
00:41:47.619 --> 00:41:50.289
You don't know what Go Eun...

592
00:41:52.489 --> 00:41:53.730
I mean, what Ye Ri is like.

593
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.300
She's so different.

594
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.929
So, what Byung Cheol said...

595
00:42:03.199 --> 00:42:04.239
Stop.

596
00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:09.469
Don't talk about him. It was hard to dump him.

597
00:42:09.469 --> 00:42:10.579
Gosh, don't.

598
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.750
Did you think that women would like this kind of present?

599
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.320
Gosh, men.

600
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.719
If you ever date anyone else,

601
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:26.090
don't give something like that.

602
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.690
Pretending to like a present...

603
00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:32.329
is harder than it looks.

604
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.000
We've only met for a short while, but it was fun.

605
00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:39.769
Bye.

606
00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:41.909
Goodbye.

607
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:49.380
What is it now?

608
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.050
Now that you know everything,

609
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:55.820
don't follow me and get lost.

610
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:57.789
I...

611
00:42:58.119 --> 00:43:02.059
need to talk to Ye Ri. What should I do?

612
00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:05.260
I don't think she'll want to see you.

613
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.400
Don't act so indecently.

614
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.900
I think you should give her up now.

615
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.239
We'll take care of that.

616
00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:16.610
- Stay out of this. - What?

617
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:18.380
Stay out of this.

618
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.050
If you say so.

619
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.420
You said you wanted to talk to her.

620
00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:30.019
Don't move. Stay still.

621
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:16.869
So, you're saying...

622
00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:21.570
that if you get asked out in front of people, she comes out?

623
00:44:21.769 --> 00:44:22.769
Yes.

624
00:44:23.909 --> 00:44:26.409
Her name is Han Ju Ri.

625
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.380
She has a name?

626
00:44:30.579 --> 00:44:31.619
Anyway...

627
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.750
Han Ju Ri...

628
00:44:34.619 --> 00:44:35.789
comes out?

629
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.059
Yes.

630
00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:40.059
Is that why you wanted to...

631
00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:42.190
keep us a secret?

632
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.239
You shouldn't have kept this a secret.

633
00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.980
- I'm sorry. - When were you going to tell me?

634
00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:00.449
If I hadn't asked, weren't you going to tell me?

635
00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:03.579
You were going to keep seeing me and

636
00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:05.119
laugh at my face...

637
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:07.119
while you were hiding such a big secret?

638
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.889
Did you think...

639
00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.630
I wouldn't find out?

640
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.599
To you,

641
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.869
the fact that I was hiding something...

642
00:45:21.699 --> 00:45:23.539
is more important to you...

643
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.409
than how I became like this and why?

644
00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:32.179
It's all right.

645
00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:33.949
I didn't...

646
00:45:35.079 --> 00:45:37.550
expect you to understand me.

647
00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:44.260
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about this earlier.

648
00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:47.389
I'm going.

649
00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:04.210
- Hello, Professor. - Hello.

650
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.050
What's wrong?

651
00:46:17.219 --> 00:46:18.320
Did something happen?

652
00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:26.030
What's wrong?

653
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.170
Why do they look so sad?

654
00:46:30.699 --> 00:46:32.699
Why do you all look so sad?

655
00:46:32.969 --> 00:46:34.469
Let's be happy.

656
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:38.340
- I... - What?

657
00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:40.650
What?

658
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.179
What is it?

659
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.050
- Is something on my face? - No.

660
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.349
- Is something on my face? - No.

661
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:48.489
No?

662
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.219
I need to go and cook rice.

663
00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:53.630
- Cook rice? - Yes.

664
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.829
- Have a good day. - Yes.

665
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:58.059
See you later. Have a good day.

666
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.639
Look at her running outfit.

667
00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:08.909
She's so liberal. Do you know what that is?

668
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.440
She's so carefree that sometimes it's too much,

669
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.449
but she's a cool girl.

670
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.050
- Joo Seung. - What?

671
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:21.920
Do you know about this?

672
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.150
About what?

673
00:47:23.719 --> 00:47:26.760
About her... I mean, him.

674
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.590
Him?

675
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.730
You know, the person that said...

676
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.630
"Have a good day."

677
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.699
Are you talking about Kyung Ae?

678
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.809
Are you making a joke to make me laugh?

679
00:47:42.409 --> 00:47:45.139
It's not that. I felt him.

680
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:46.809
But I couldn't hear his thoughts.

681
00:47:46.809 --> 00:47:49.179
I touched them. You're mistaken.

682
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.280
I thought I was too, but...

683
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.590
Why would you say it like that?

684
00:47:53.719 --> 00:47:56.219
I checked that she had two boobs.

685
00:47:56.219 --> 00:47:58.760
Look at the tightness.

686
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.690
He must have had a surgery.

687
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:03.400
Surgery?

688
00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:05.630
Joo Seung.

689
00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.469
Think carefully. Didn't anything seem strange?

690
00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.269
In Lijiang, China,

691
00:48:14.269 --> 00:48:16.139
there's a minority group called...

692
00:48:16.139 --> 00:48:17.639
Let's talk about them later.

693
00:48:19.239 --> 00:48:22.010
Kyung Ae, I didn't mean. I mean...

694
00:48:25.019 --> 00:48:26.789
- Men there... - Yes?

695
00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:29.420
never put women below them.

696
00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.389
It's a matriarchal society.

697
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.260
Matriarchal society?

698
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.889
Yes, a matriarchal society.

699
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.800
But Kyung Ae...

700
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.369
But I'm the man here. I need to...

701
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.599
I mean...

702
00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.420
2 multiplied by 2 is 2.

703
00:48:57.579 --> 00:49:01.090
Until the East sea and Mountain Baekdu...

704
00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:04.489
She talked about a minority group...

705
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.460
and its matriarchal society.

706
00:49:10.059 --> 00:49:12.400
And when I tried to get on top, she'd come on top and...

707
00:49:20.269 --> 00:49:21.670
- Gosh. - It's all right.

708
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:30.820
You are always there

709
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:39.619
I know you're the only one that will make me live right

710
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.489
You can't leave like this.

711
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.059
Let me go. There's nothing more to talk about.

712
00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:45.829
Now that she's come out,

713
00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:47.670
it's over.

714
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.929
What? Over?

715
00:49:50.199 --> 00:49:51.639
When people see her,

716
00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.710
they run because they're scared,

717
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.840
or tell me she's weird.

718
00:49:56.239 --> 00:49:58.179
They don't want to get near me.

719
00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.909
You'll be the same.

720
00:50:00.909 --> 00:50:02.809
Don't be so sure.

721
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.019
It might not be the case.

722
00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:08.389
I wanted to be a normal girlfriend for you.

723
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.059
A normal person like others.

724
00:50:13.019 --> 00:50:15.090
Then you can stop her from coming out.

725
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.059
If I want to stop her,

726
00:50:20.929 --> 00:50:22.769
you need to disappear from my sight.

727
00:50:24.099 --> 00:50:26.909
We need to stop seeing each other to stop her.

728
00:50:26.909 --> 00:50:28.840
Then what do you want me to do?

729
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.579
I'm sorry.

730
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.789
You shouldn't have started this in the first place.

731
00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:49.789
Han Ye Ri.

732
00:50:51.159 --> 00:50:52.559
You shouldn't have.

733
00:50:55.769 --> 00:51:01.010
I probably have to hold on to you

734
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:07.780
- My wild thoughts and anxious looks - My wild thoughts and anxious looks

735
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.420
- You'll be watching all of this - You'll be watching all of this

736
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.820
- It'll probably be a war-like love - It'll probably be a war-like love

737
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.289
- Because I'm dangerous - Because I'm dangerous

738
00:51:21.289 --> 00:51:27.000
- Because I love you - Because I love you

739
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.739
- I will leave you - I will leave you

740
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.010
(Ye Ri)

741
00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:48.150
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

742
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.159
Why would she turn her phone off? It could be dangerous.

743
00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:03.539
But I need to give this to her.

744
00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:06.070
I even inscribed her initials.

745
00:52:09.369 --> 00:52:10.380
And...

746
00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:13.349
I'll get to see her again.

747
00:52:31.699 --> 00:52:32.800
Ye Ri.

748
00:52:38.599 --> 00:52:39.599
Ye Ri.

749
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:43.739
Ye Ri?

750
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:01.030
Ye Ri!

751
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.760
Are you all right? What happened?

752
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.929
What's with this outfit?

753
00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:15.510
Run, Eun Ho!

754
00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.010
Behind you...

755
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:36.090
You don't know what Go Eun...

756
00:53:37.159 --> 00:53:38.159
I mean, what Ye Ri is like.

757
00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:42.300
How different she is.

758
00:53:45.969 --> 00:53:47.309
Even her name is pretty.

759
00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:49.809
Han Ye Ri.

760
00:53:52.909 --> 00:53:53.909
You...

761
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.840
(Meloholic)

762
00:54:20.869 --> 00:54:23.010
I had a really bad dream.

763
00:54:23.409 --> 00:54:26.380
You called me. That's how I woke up.

764
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.909
Kim Sun Ho can't do that to Ye Ri.

765
00:54:28.909 --> 00:54:30.250
His name is Kim Sun Ho?

766
00:54:30.619 --> 00:54:33.280
- You won't be able to stand her. - I can.

767
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.849
Gosh, I like this. You should go out with me.

768
00:54:37.389 --> 00:54:38.659
Gosh.

769
00:54:39.019 --> 00:54:41.860
You'll fall more and more in love with me.

770
00:54:42.329 --> 00:54:43.360
All right.

771
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.969
Do you like it better with Ye Ri or Ju Ri?

772
00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:49.869
- Good morning. - Go back inside.

773
00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:54.369
You don't need to worry anymore.

774
00:54:54.469 --> 00:54:55.969
Everything will be fine from now on.
