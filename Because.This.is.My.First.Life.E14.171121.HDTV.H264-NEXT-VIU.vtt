00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.379
Ji Ho, where are you?

2
00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.279
I'm just outside home.

3
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.849
Hello.

4
00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.749
Yes. Hello.

5
00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.430
Do you live here? In this neighborhood?

6
00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:11.499
Yes.

7
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.740
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.510
I was just passing by.

9
00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:38.590
I see.

10
00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.430
- Should I give you my name card? - What?

11
00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.329
Okay.

12
00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.570
Let's grab tea sometime.

13
00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.010
I'm a little frazzled right now.

14
00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.850
Sure. Let's do that.

15
00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.390
Are you all right?

16
00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.390
Did you go to the washroom?

17
00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.400
Yes. What about you?

18
00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.930
Are you feeling all right?

19
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.270
I'm completely sober now.

20
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.710
I had fun tonight.

21
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.840
I'll get going.

22
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.210
I'll drive you to your place.

23
00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.150
It's very close from here.

24
00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.289
I'm going to walk so I can get sober.

25
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.390
Is your husband coming to get you?

26
00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.830
I was a little slow.

27
00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.930
Take care, then.

28
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.809
(Ko Jung Min)

29
00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:43.479
(Wife)

30
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.650
Hello?

31
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.490
Ji Ho. Where are you?

32
00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.830
Here.

33
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.930
Pardon?

34
00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.710
Why didn't you pick up...

35
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.909
your phone?

36
00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.580
I didn't have a chance.

37
00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.950
I'm sorry. I was going to call.

38
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.820
Let's go in.

39
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.159
For some reason, I could drink a lot today.

40
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.000
Maybe it's because I haven't drunk in a while.

41
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.869
I see.

42
00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.799
Did you drink...

43
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.239
with the production company?

44
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.010
Yes.

45
00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.409
The CEO is a good drinker too.

46
00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.619
Drink this instead of cold water. Or you'll be sick tomorrow.

47
00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:30.460
Keep this by your bedside tonight.

48
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.159
You might wake up feeling sick in the middle of the night.

49
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.570
It's warm.

50
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.739
Thank you.

51
00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.020
Goodnight.

52
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.789
Goodnight.

53
00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:05.659
Ji Ho.

54
00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:07.929
Yes?

55
00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:09.760
Do you...

56
00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:13.630
want to sleep together again tonight?

57
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.310
No, tonight's a little...

58
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.140
I see.

59
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.750
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.580
No, it's not like that.

61
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:32.320
I'm just a little tired.

62
00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.820
I snore more on days like this.

63
00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:40.529
I understand.

64
00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:44.700
I'll make more tea, so have it if you need to.

65
00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:46.929
Okay.

66
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.029
I was engaged once.

67
00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.159
I was almost married once.

68
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.299
The only things I can handle in life,

69
00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:21.039
are this house, Kitty, and myself.

70
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.500
We were dating, and I got pregnant with his baby.

71
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.039
Marriage isn't about just the couple.

72
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.140
More than their feelings, it's a system that relies...

73
00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:31.549
more on the understanding of the surrounding people.

74
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.950
I miscarried my baby and we broke up.

75
00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.919
His family was against our relationship too.

76
00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:39.549
I just wish...

77
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.690
nothing would happen in my life.

78
00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:05.250
(Ko Jung Min)

79
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.919
Some production company's CEO came to talk to me.

80
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:12.950
She wasn't ordinary.

81
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.820
She was strong...

82
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.760
in a way that she doesn't hurt others but...

83
00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:20.630
protects instead.

84
00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:24.529
She's kind of like a tree.

85
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.649
Hello?

86
00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.820
It's me.

87
00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.719
Yes. I know.

88
00:08:48.359 --> 00:08:51.359
I'm sorry to call when it's late.

89
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.560
There is something I should tell you.

90
00:08:55.259 --> 00:08:56.359
Okay.

91
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.629
Congratulations on getting the chance...

92
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.300
to write again.

93
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.310
This man is torn.

94
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.580
I'm so glad...

95
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.920
He's afraid.

96
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.420
you're starting over again.

97
00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:23.920
He's nervous.

98
00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:27.859
Thank you.

99
00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:33.399
Sleep well, Ji Ho.

100
00:09:35.499 --> 00:09:36.599
Okay.

101
00:09:38.109 --> 00:09:39.440
You too.

102
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.149
(Episode 14: Because This Is My First Confession)

103
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.719
Should I just cut it like usual?

104
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.389
No.

105
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.769
Are you here?

106
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.050
I'm sorry I contacted you out of the blue. I know you're busy.

107
00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:22.879
The CEO isn't busy.

108
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.590
My employees are the ones that are busy.

109
00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:28.920
Wow, Ho Rang. You got a cut.

110
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.759
Yes. I needed a change of scenery.

111
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.330
It looks really good on you.

112
00:10:43.969 --> 00:10:45.239
Won Seok...

113
00:10:46.609 --> 00:10:48.479
really means it, right?

114
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.119
Please, tell me.

115
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.619
I want to get myself sorted out,

116
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.160
but I didn't have anyone else to ask.

117
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.229
He means it, right?

118
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.369
For now,

119
00:11:13.969 --> 00:11:15.700
yes. I think so.

120
00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:19.340
Then...

121
00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:22.139
Even if I beg him,

122
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.979
he won't come back to me. Right?

123
00:11:31.489 --> 00:11:32.749
Won Seok...

124
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:38.090
seems to think that he's making you unhappy.

125
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.160
That's why he decided to let you go.

126
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.040
It's not because he wants to let go?

127
00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:53.639
I'm not sure,

128
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.950
but if one thinks they're making their loved ones suffer,

129
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.219
it makes them hate themselves.

130
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.590
It feels miserable too.

131
00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:08.960
Okay.

132
00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:13.729
This is just where it ends for us.

133
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:20.769
Sir.

134
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.109
- Mr. Shin. - Hello.

135
00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:25.440
- Have you been well? - Yes.

136
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.310
- Are you dropping by the office? - Yes.

137
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.180
I had a financial consultation meeting.

138
00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:35.580
Aren't you going to introduce me?

139
00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:39.389
Could she be your...

140
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:40.590
No, no.

141
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.690
She's a close friend's non-girlfriend.

142
00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:47.560
She's my girlfriend's best friend.

143
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.530
Ho Rang. Yang Ho Rang.

144
00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:54.399
Your girlfriend's best friend?

145
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.670
Hello.

146
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.080
My name is Shin Young Pyo. I take care of his business finances.

147
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.649
I see. I don't have a business card.

148
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.349
I'll get going.

149
00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:09.379
Okay, Ho Rang.

150
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.249
I'll be in touch. Take care.

151
00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:13.349
Okay.

152
00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:15.759
Okay.

153
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.820
Mr. Ma told me you're going to Sillim-dong.

154
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.550
- Yes. - I'll give you a ride.

155
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.119
The buses here run very infrequently.

156
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.119
No, it's okay.

157
00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:51.889
I'm not a bad guy.

158
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:54.129
I've known Mr. Ma for a long time.

159
00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:00.570
Do you live around there?

160
00:14:02.869 --> 00:14:04.369
No.

161
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.910
I just have to pick up some stuff.

162
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.680
I see.

163
00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:14.479
Ho Rang, do you really not know who I am?

164
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:16.849
Pardon?

165
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.149
I want to get married.

166
00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:19.690
What?

167
00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:23.259
"Dating Instead of Marriage". We chatted before...

168
00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:24.790
because you accepted my request.

169
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.160
I was actually really surprised earlier.

170
00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:32.800
I recognized you right away.

171
00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.499
I see.

172
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.440
You were the first person I talked to when I got the app.

173
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.479
But you wouldn't reply after that one time.

174
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.609
I figured that you dumped me.

175
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.580
Well...

176
00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:54.590
I had just downloaded the app then,

177
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.820
so I replied without thinking.

178
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.359
It's Mr. Ma's app, so...

179
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.070
Are you trying to draw a line between us?

180
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.129
- What? - What is this?

181
00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:09.969
Are you surprised because I caught on?

182
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.139
You can't deny it, can you?

183
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.849
Thank you for the ride. Take care.

184
00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:25.950
Okay...

185
00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:30.119
Take care.

186
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:15.769
(Let's love each other forever!)

187
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.649
(Let's love each other forever!)

188
00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:30.219
(5th year anniversary)

189
00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:32.590
(100th day anniversary)

190
00:16:34.219 --> 00:16:35.859
(Our happy home)

191
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.259
(Our happy home)

192
00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:51.239
(I love you, honey! I love you, Ho Rang!)

193
00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:34.080
You were right.

194
00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:37.949
I'll become more honest...

195
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.619
to my feelings.

196
00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:53.070
Why are you...

197
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.300
Didn't you leave?

198
00:17:55.369 --> 00:17:58.970
You said you had luggage to pick up, and I thought it'd be heavy.

199
00:17:59.169 --> 00:18:01.580
You seemed to be in a bad condition too.

200
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.379
What?

201
00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:06.679
- I'll give you a ride home. - No.

202
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.980
You're making me uncomfortable.

203
00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:13.090
You're going to have a bad flu for certain.

204
00:18:13.649 --> 00:18:16.689
From whichever side I look at you, you're definitely having a flu.

205
00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.459
What?

206
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.959
I mean, you look like you're about to faint.

207
00:18:22.459 --> 00:18:24.899
So how can I turn a blind eye?

208
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.869
Give it to me.

209
00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:36.379
Shall I?

210
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:12.280
We'll file a lawsuit following this process.

211
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.419
As they go through an investigation, you'll have to...

212
00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.349
be questioned as a victim.

213
00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:20.790
Are you okay with it?

214
00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:25.090
Yes, I'm aware of it.

215
00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:30.000
Fortunately, you have the text messages and call history...

216
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.470
to prove your claim against him.

217
00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:36.340
But if they start using media and news articles,

218
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.010
things might get a bit messy.

219
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.340
This matter is about the broadcasting industry after all.

220
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.379
Yes, I'll have to brace myself for that.

221
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.349
Okay, then we'll proceed accordingly.

222
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.320
Oh, and...

223
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.320
This is our contract.

224
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.530
(Writing Contract)

225
00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:02.459
You don't have to sign it right now.

226
00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.699
Take it and read it carefully.

227
00:20:04.699 --> 00:20:07.300
Tell me if you want any changes.

228
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.669
(Writing Contract)

229
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.609
But...

230
00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:19.050
the payment is...

231
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.419
Should we discuss it more?

232
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.050
It's much less than what you expected.

233
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.419
No.

234
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.459
I think it's too much.

235
00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:36.859
Ms. Yoon.

236
00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:39.330
You shouldn't do that.

237
00:20:40.129 --> 00:20:41.270
What?

238
00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:45.109
Even if you're surprised, you should go outside and express it alone.

239
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.169
We're going under a contract.

240
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.010
You can't express yourself so honestly to your enemy.

241
00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:56.149
You're...

242
00:20:57.619 --> 00:20:59.320
not my enemy.

243
00:21:03.389 --> 00:21:04.859
It's not much.

244
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.800
It's the amount we mostly offer to our new writers.

245
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.340
We don't sign contracts with writers that often to be honest.

246
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.169
But once we do it, we do it properly.

247
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.879
If we want to work with them for a long time.

248
00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:27.980
Ms. Ko.

249
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.419
Yes?

250
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.119
Shall we...

251
00:21:32.689 --> 00:21:34.320
have a meal together today?

252
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.889
Sure.

253
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.699
("I Remember")

254
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.810
("It's More Important to Work on Good Pieces than Many Pieces")

255
00:21:55.109 --> 00:21:57.510
(Does it mean something to your company name?)

256
00:21:59.149 --> 00:22:02.919
(I started this work because I was desperate for money.)

257
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.619
(What money does is the easiest and lightest.)

258
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.629
(Ko Jung Min)

259
00:22:24.139 --> 00:22:26.909
Did you relieve your hangover in the morning?

260
00:22:29.209 --> 00:22:31.649
I drank some honey water before I went to bed last night.

261
00:22:32.609 --> 00:22:33.750
So I felt okay in the morning.

262
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.520
Did your husband make it for you?

263
00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:41.189
Yes.

264
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.590
My husband...

265
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.099
made it for me.

266
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.980
Before I sign the contract, I want to ask you about something.

267
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.119
Okay, Ms. Yoon.

268
00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:12.820
It's about the man you talked about before.

269
00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:16.889
The man you almost got married with.

270
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.000
Yes.

271
00:23:24.099 --> 00:23:25.669
What would you feel...

272
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.500
if you ran into him again?

273
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.780
Do you think...

274
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.240
you'd love him...

275
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.149
if you met him again?

276
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:46.820
This...

277
00:23:47.889 --> 00:23:50.790
is related to our contract?

278
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.060
Yes.

279
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.699
It's related to our contract,

280
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.500
and it's very important.

281
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.669
Actually,

282
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.270
I ran into him.

283
00:24:07.209 --> 00:24:08.480
I mean, that man.

284
00:24:13.609 --> 00:24:15.780
The day I went to your neighborhood.

285
00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:19.790
That day, I ran into him coincidentally.

286
00:24:22.889 --> 00:24:25.889
So your question feels...

287
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:27.659
a little...

288
00:24:30.629 --> 00:24:33.629
It feels stranger...

289
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.300
to me.

290
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.209
That day,

291
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.050
my husband came out to see me.

292
00:24:57.459 --> 00:24:58.659
I mean, Se Hee.

293
00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:11.869
The way I see it, you've never faced the world properly.

294
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:14.280
Using your company and mother as excuses,

295
00:25:14.639 --> 00:25:17.080
you've always blamed the world.

296
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.580
I believe that you need to face the world...

297
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.820
and say what you want to say at least for once in your life.

298
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:26.820
And once you begin,

299
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.919
I'll be ready to support you by your side.

300
00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:43.169
Hi.

301
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.510
Are you back from a meeting with your client?

302
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.580
Yes, we had things to discuss regarding additional investment.

303
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.280
Okay, good day.

304
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.649
Mr. Park.

305
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.619
How about we go out for a smoke?

306
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.419
- Now? - Yes.

307
00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:05.790
No, I'm fine.

308
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.869
What is it that you want to say?

309
00:26:16.899 --> 00:26:19.570
I joined this team in 2015,

310
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.480
so it's been already three years since I started to work with you.

311
00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:26.409
It means 800 days by day...

312
00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:29.250
and 7,200 hours by hour.

313
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.189
- Is that right? - Yes.

314
00:26:31.849 --> 00:26:34.619
And most of those times...

315
00:26:35.189 --> 00:26:38.359
felt so horrible for me, Mr. Park.

316
00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:41.199
- Horrible? - Yes.

317
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.330
Whenever we had a team dinner,

318
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.270
I wondered how I should react to your sexually harassing jokes.

319
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.369
On a day after my leave,

320
00:26:50.399 --> 00:26:53.240
I expected you'd ask where I went with my boyfriend.

321
00:26:54.139 --> 00:26:55.879
I wondered how I should react to that.

322
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.010
On a sick day,

323
00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.349
I pretended I wasn't because I was worried...

324
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.220
you might ask if I was on my period again.

325
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:06.389
Thinking of you, Mr. Park,

326
00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.189
it's hideous and painful.

327
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:14.030
We're colleagues who have worked together for 7,200 hours.

328
00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:16.359
Isn't it so sad?

329
00:27:19.099 --> 00:27:20.300
So...

330
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.540
what is it that you want to say?

331
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.570
I want you to apologize for everything...

332
00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:27.639
that you've hurt me with.

333
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.909
- What? - I need to get an apology...

334
00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:32.780
from you.

335
00:27:33.709 --> 00:27:35.679
Apologize officially...

336
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.050
in front of all our team members.

337
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.919
- Apologize? - I really...

338
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.030
want to end this horrible relationship...

339
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:46.189
with you now.

340
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.359
I was sincere in telling you this.

341
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.040
So please show me your sincerity.

342
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.240
I will wait.

343
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:10.080
The leaves are falling

344
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.330
- Soo Ji. - Yes?

345
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.030
What happened?

346
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.669
Nothing much.

347
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.169
I'm just happy to see you.

348
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.980
Why are you so cute?

349
00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:40.349
You were right about it.

350
00:28:40.849 --> 00:28:42.780
I always tried to avoid and talked behind his back.

351
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.359
But I haven't really talked to Mr. Park in person.

352
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:50.020
He's somebody's son and somebody's father.

353
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:51.830
He's just one of us.

354
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.730
My Soo Ji is such an amazing person.

355
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.570
Come here.

356
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.340
What are you doing?

357
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.439
Am I not supposed to do this?

358
00:29:06.439 --> 00:29:07.580
No, you are not.

359
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.250
Oh, I see.

360
00:29:13.449 --> 00:29:17.550
The autumn leaves are

361
00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:20.689
Falling down

362
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.330
It's falling down

363
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.449
(Ko Jung Min)

364
00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:46.780
Ko Jung Min?

365
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.389
(Ko Jung Min)

366
00:29:58.189 --> 00:29:59.389
Jung Min?

367
00:30:05.129 --> 00:30:06.800
(Ko Jung Min)

368
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.240
I can't believe it.

369
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.109
How can you guys meet each other again like this?

370
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.209
Does Ji Ho...

371
00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:19.649
know about it too?

372
00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:26.419
I mean, how would she know this unbelievable situation though?

373
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.689
Are they going to work together still?

374
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.590
Maybe.

375
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.629
Don't you need to talk to her about it first?

376
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.439
It's not like they are going to meet only a few times.

377
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:44.810
They will have to meet a lot.

378
00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:46.810
It's the CEO and the scriptwriter of the production company.

379
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.280
What should I tell her?

380
00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:58.090
I don't even know where to start.

381
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.590
Which part should I tell her and which part should I not tell her?

382
00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:06.090
Should I tell Ji Ho I used to date her in the past?

383
00:31:07.429 --> 00:31:09.099
Should I tell her it was the time...

384
00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:12.030
when everything was going south because of how immature I was.

385
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.109
No matter what I say, it's going to hurt her.

386
00:31:19.439 --> 00:31:22.939
Ji Ho is an innocent person.

387
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:28.080
I don't want to ruin it...

388
00:31:29.449 --> 00:31:30.580
by telling her my past.

389
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.830
I wasn't talking about Ji Ho.

390
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:41.359
I was talking about Jung Min.

391
00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:45.830
I was wondering how you would explain Ji Ho to Jung Min.

392
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.230
That was my question.

393
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:50.810
I thought you couldn't get over Jung Min.

394
00:31:51.939 --> 00:31:54.780
I thought that's why you got married ...

395
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.449
under the contract.

396
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:00.820
I thought Ji Ho was just...

397
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.389
in the contractual relationship with you.

398
00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:10.760
Wasn't she just a tenant to you?

399
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.869
So it's not Jung Min you are worried about.

400
00:32:42.189 --> 00:32:44.429
(Ko Jung Min)

401
00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:48.530
I thought I could meet her again...

402
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.429
maybe once in my life.

403
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.310
I even thought of what I should do when that happens.

404
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.169
"How are you?"

405
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.679
"It's been a while."

406
00:33:03.879 --> 00:33:06.909
But as soon as I saw you,

407
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.879
I realized...

408
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.389
I was worried about the other person.

409
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.619
When did it...

410
00:33:16.959 --> 00:33:18.590
even start?

411
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.199
I thought the only things remaining in my life are...

412
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:27.899
(Ko Jung Min)

413
00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:31.909
the autumn leaves...

414
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.310
that are solid dry.

415
00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.980
I thought the rest of my life would be...

416
00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:46.849
the time I would spend by myself...

417
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.990
waiting for those leaves to fall down.

418
00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:01.199
I didn't want to do anything that could decide...

419
00:34:02.869 --> 00:34:05.139
the other person's life.

420
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.019
("Although Nothing Will Change Even If You Cry")

421
00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.249
I thought I would never...

422
00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:24.430
make someone cry again.

423
00:34:25.859 --> 00:34:27.800
Here he is. Hey, 401!

424
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.809
Where's Se Hee?

425
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:46.879
He left work early today.

426
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.189
Are you going to mess up the program just because of your ex?

427
00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:57.359
It's been only two weeks since you started working here.

428
00:34:57.459 --> 00:34:58.559
What?

429
00:35:04.129 --> 00:35:05.229
I'm sorry.

430
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.300
How did you know that?

431
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.709
How can I not know? It's written on your face.

432
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.939
Is it?

433
00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:21.220
Being in a relationship means it ends at some point.

434
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.720
It's not even a thing to show off like this.

435
00:35:23.479 --> 00:35:25.090
Come on, it was just one of the relationships you had in your life.

436
00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:27.590
It was the one and only relationship I had in my life.

437
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.129
Was it?

438
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:37.930
Does it mean it was your first time with her?

439
00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:40.669
What do you mean?

440
00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:44.410
Breaking up, of course.

441
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.249
- You guys did a great job. - Take care.

442
00:36:02.919 --> 00:36:04.660
It looks like you are really busy today, Ho Rang.

443
00:36:04.959 --> 00:36:07.300
Did you go home well on that day, Ho Rang?

444
00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:10.229
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

445
00:36:31.249 --> 00:36:32.350
Ho Rang!

446
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.499
I wasn't late, right?

447
00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:45.669
I left as soon as you texted me back.

448
00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.999
- I see. - You must be hungry.

449
00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:50.039
- What are you in the mood for? - I don't want to eat.

450
00:36:50.269 --> 00:36:52.269
Let's just have some beer.

451
00:36:53.939 --> 00:36:55.039
Beer?

452
00:36:57.609 --> 00:37:00.550
I'd love that.

453
00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:02.680
Let's do it.

454
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.030
Cheers!

455
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.300
You must be really thirsty.

456
00:37:22.669 --> 00:37:24.109
Did you get home safely on that day?

457
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:29.240
I dated this guy for seven years.

458
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:32.010
I just broke up with him.

459
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:35.649
When you drove me home,

460
00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:40.419
it was the day I moved out...

461
00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:42.359
from the place I lived with him.

462
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:47.959
Wait,

463
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.169
how could you have such a small luggage?

464
00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:56.600
Sorry?

465
00:37:57.169 --> 00:37:58.309
Well.

466
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.039
No matter how long a couple lived together,

467
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.280
they don't have much stuff to get rid of when they break up.

468
00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.579
I also dated my first girlfriend for seven years.

469
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.789
By the way, why did you break up with her?

470
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:21.359
We fought a lot about getting married.

471
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:25.169
Dating and getting married are two different stories.

472
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:36.140
So what's your plan to overcome this?

473
00:38:37.979 --> 00:38:39.079
Sorry?

474
00:38:39.379 --> 00:38:40.749
I mean your breakup.

475
00:38:40.879 --> 00:38:43.249
Have you planned on how to overcome your breakup?

476
00:38:46.689 --> 00:38:49.260
I don't have any plans yet.

477
00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.030
Time will heal everything.

478
00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:56.999
How can time heal everything?

479
00:38:57.329 --> 00:38:58.999
Time just passes, that is all.

480
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:01.939
What I hate the most...

481
00:39:02.269 --> 00:39:04.939
are those idioms.

482
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:08.809
Don't you ever fall for any of those overly said idioms, Ho Rang.

483
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.680
Overly... what?

484
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:16.079
What you eagerly long for...

485
00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:18.390
only will come true when you say it aloud.

486
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.919
So I said my wishes aloud every day and night...

487
00:39:20.959 --> 00:39:23.019
watching myself in the mirror.

488
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.289
What did you say?

489
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.530
"I can get over her."

490
00:39:29.229 --> 00:39:31.030
"I can overcome this breakup."

491
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.200
"With strong mind and soul,

492
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.499
get over with whatever is given!"

493
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.410
Don't use difficult languages with me.

494
00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:43.079
I'm too ignorant to understand.

495
00:39:43.709 --> 00:39:44.879
This...

496
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.180
is not some difficult language. It's what teenagers use.

497
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.689
What?

498
00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.120
Why would you use such language?

499
00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.660
It makes me feel better. I feel younger.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.160
Yes.

509
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.870
I know. You have left your bag.

510
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:42.640
Yes.

511
00:40:44.209 --> 00:40:45.470
I didn't know...

512
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.240
that Ji Ho got married.

513
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.079
I'm sorry.

514
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.990
I was too drunk the other night. I don't remember much.

515
00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:00.760
I mean it. Please believe me.

516
00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:05.390
I'll do anything to compensate for you with settlement money.

517
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.660
I mean...

518
00:41:10.059 --> 00:41:13.070
Could you please withdraw the complaint?

519
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.609
I have to work on a new project.

520
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.539
What?

521
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.320
I dreamed about me walking...

522
00:41:27.879 --> 00:41:30.249
into some endless tunnel.

523
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.530
I mean...

524
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.370
I thought you knew.

525
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.870
I think I have to talk with Ji Ho.

526
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.079
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

527
00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.539
I'll speak to Ji Ho.

528
00:42:05.419 --> 00:42:06.450
Sit down.

529
00:42:07.419 --> 00:42:08.689
Talk to me.

530
00:42:09.519 --> 00:42:11.629
Tell me everything truthfully.

531
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:15.129
Thank you so much...

532
00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:18.600
for telling me something hard to share.

533
00:42:20.769 --> 00:42:23.939
I have one question, too.

534
00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:28.740
It's about Se Hee.

535
00:42:30.039 --> 00:42:32.609
What would your conclusion be if I answered yes to your question,

536
00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:37.590
"Will you be happy..."

537
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.220
"if you get back with Se Hee?"

538
00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.890
If that is the case,

539
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.530
I would have ended up as your enemy.

540
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.070
Were we supposed to fight?

541
00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.109
Are we supposed to fight like cats and dogs here?

542
00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:03.840
I would have waited...

543
00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:07.950
for Se Hee's heart.

544
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.050
You would wait for his heart.

545
00:43:13.789 --> 00:43:16.320
Why would you? Is it because your marriage is contract based?

546
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.800
Even if we were married without any terms...

547
00:43:21.859 --> 00:43:23.760
I would have done the same.

548
00:43:26.269 --> 00:43:27.669
A married couple...

549
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.340
does not always win...

550
00:43:31.439 --> 00:43:34.140
each other's hearts.

551
00:43:36.879 --> 00:43:37.979
Is that so?

552
00:43:39.379 --> 00:43:43.350
But isn't marriage about getting each other's hearts?

553
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:48.359
It's rather an official way...

554
00:43:49.289 --> 00:43:51.229
of declaring that a couple has won each other's hearts.

555
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.100
So this marriage makes it hard for people to easily break up...

556
00:43:54.859 --> 00:43:57.829
even if they don't have feelings for each other anymore.

557
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.800
I don't know.

558
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.970
It's my first time getting married.

559
00:44:06.939 --> 00:44:08.109
It's my first time loving someone too.

560
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:14.950
So I don't know much about this.

561
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.590
I know one thing for sure.

562
00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:25.930
Winning someone's heart is not a game.

563
00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.160
It rather comes naturally.

564
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.010
Please don't tell Se Hee...

565
00:44:41.709 --> 00:44:43.979
that I know what happened.

566
00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.240
Good bye.

567
00:45:10.939 --> 00:45:14.039
Go back to your life and live well.

568
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.780
Instead,

569
00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:19.709
don't ever fall for anyone.

570
00:45:21.479 --> 00:45:25.019
You don't have the right to.

571
00:45:25.019 --> 00:45:28.990
(You don't have the right to love.)

572
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.530
So she's right.

573
00:45:34.499 --> 00:45:36.959
Winning someone's heart is not a game.

574
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.669
She knew it so quickly.

575
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.870
How I wish I was Ji Ho.

576
00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:53.350
Your call was long.

577
00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:55.419
Yes, it was the lawyer.

578
00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:58.149
There have been some problems with Ji Ho's lawsuit against the guy.

579
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.590
What? What kind of problem?

580
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:01.620
Well.

581
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.160
The guy went to ask for the charges to be dropped.

582
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:08.829
But he got beaten up really hard.

583
00:46:10.629 --> 00:46:12.100
By whom?

584
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.970
Ji Ho's husband.

585
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.169
What?

586
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.039
You mean he beat someone up?

587
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.010
- It's been long! - Yes, it has been really long.

588
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.879
You did a good job this year.

589
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.010
- Let's do well again next year. - Yes, sir.

590
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:29.450
Everyone, let me propose a toast.

591
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.950
Fill in your empty glasses.

592
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.890
- Why don't you give a toast? - Yes, sir.

593
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.930
2017 is almost over.

594
00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.590
Our respected director,

595
00:46:40.959 --> 00:46:42.800
I love you, sir!

596
00:46:43.629 --> 00:46:47.070
And to our business supporting team, you all have done a good job.

597
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.640
Let's toast for our most respected director with all our hearts.

598
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:52.840
When I say "Director!",

599
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.579
you all say "I love you, sir!"

600
00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:58.510
I forgot about the apology.

601
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.820
I'm sorry, Ms. Woo.

602
00:47:01.249 --> 00:47:02.649
I have been very naughty.

603
00:47:02.919 --> 00:47:05.919
Let's all forget about it with our drinks.

604
00:47:07.459 --> 00:47:09.620
I'll say "Director!"

605
00:47:09.859 --> 00:47:11.530
- I love you, sir! - I love you, sir!

606
00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:12.930
I love you all, too!

607
00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:16.300
- Drink it up. - Bottoms up.

608
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.829
Do you need more drinks?

609
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:19.499
- Where shall we go next? - Second round sounds good.

610
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.870
Was there anything between you two?

611
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.800
No, nothing happened.

612
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:25.169
Have your food.

613
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.680
- Drink it up. - Let's all drink.

614
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.649
Pass me the glass.

615
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:35.050
- I'll go home first. - See you tomorrow, sir.

616
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.879
- Don't get late to work. - We won't!

617
00:47:37.249 --> 00:47:39.090
- Bye. - See you all tomorrow.

618
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.189
- How about we have more drinks? - Sure!

619
00:47:45.059 --> 00:47:47.329
Let's eat some beef sashimi and go for karaoke afterwards.

620
00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:49.800
- Okay, sure. Karaoke sounds fun. - I'll drop by the office first.

621
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.169
You all wait here.

622
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.070
- Meet us at the beef sashimi place. - See you later.

623
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:03.240
Alright! It's a desert island!

624
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.979
Whose turn is it next?

625
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.289
Hi, babe.

626
00:48:11.289 --> 00:48:13.590
Isn't language for humans?

627
00:48:14.189 --> 00:48:15.220
You're right.

628
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.059
Languages only work for humans. Am I right?

629
00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:20.829
You're right. If language doesn't work for someone, he's not a human.

630
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:23.829
Either he's an animal, an insect, or a water flea.

631
00:48:24.269 --> 00:48:25.329
Why do you ask?

632
00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:26.430
Honey.

633
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.769
Did you mean it when you said you'll stand by me once I start?

634
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.709
- Of course, I meant it. - What are you doing Mr. Ma?

635
00:48:33.709 --> 00:48:35.879
- It's your turn to roll. - Throw the dice.

636
00:48:36.379 --> 00:48:37.550
Mr. Ma!

637
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.180
Okay. Have fun playing with dice.

638
00:48:44.649 --> 00:48:45.820
I love you.

639
00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:53.030
Hello? Hello?

640
00:48:57.329 --> 00:49:00.269
What is this supposed to be? It sounds like a will.

641
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.840
Mr. Ma, it's your turn. Come on! Throw the dice.

642
00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:08.510
- Is it Seoul? - She can't be...

643
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.879
Goodness, I lost.

644
00:49:10.079 --> 00:49:12.379
No. No. No. No.

645
00:49:12.379 --> 00:49:13.709
What do you mean?

646
00:49:13.709 --> 00:49:16.879
Mr. Ma, you have to buy Seoul now.

647
00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.720
Coward.

648
00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:44.510
Ms. Woo should upload the photo of her body.

649
00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.879
B? B? No. No. No.

650
00:49:47.879 --> 00:49:51.220
It's full size A.

651
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:53.919
If I weren't married,

652
00:49:53.919 --> 00:49:57.220
I would have had fun with Ms. Woo.

653
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:14.309
Ms. Woo, why did you come back to the office?

654
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:16.640
I have some undone work.

655
00:50:17.579 --> 00:50:18.680
Really?

656
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.120
- Jin Ho! - What did you say?

657
00:50:45.269 --> 00:50:47.809
I'll roll the dice now.

658
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:51.709
I'm buying Taipei.

659
00:50:51.709 --> 00:50:53.680
I was going to buy that.

660
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.680
A rabbit is the king when the tiger is not around.

661
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.249
Is this all your land?

662
00:50:59.249 --> 00:51:02.419
We have raised a baby tiger.

663
00:51:02.419 --> 00:51:04.859
That's what I mean. You should have bought it.

664
00:51:04.859 --> 00:51:07.430
You'll only catch the tiger if you go into the tiger's cave.

665
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.959
Let's stop playing this game.

666
00:51:08.959 --> 00:51:11.030
Why? It's getting fun.

667
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.470
It's not fun at all. It's for kids.

668
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:13.729
We're always playing this.

669
00:51:13.729 --> 00:51:15.840
Let's all go drink. I'll treat tonight.

670
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.669
- Really? - Your treat?

671
00:51:17.669 --> 00:51:20.470
Yes, I'll buy you all drinks. Let's stay up until the dawn.

672
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.840
I'll leave first then.

673
00:51:23.209 --> 00:51:24.879
You should go with us too.

674
00:51:25.379 --> 00:51:27.350
It's okay. I have an appointment.

675
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.479
What kind of appointment do you have at this hour?

676
00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.320
It's an appointment with myself.

677
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.490
You all have fun. I'll go now.

678
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.490
It's Friday, right?

679
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:40.160
She must be going to Itaewon.

680
00:51:40.459 --> 00:51:44.100
- Itaewon? - There's a famous toy shop there.

681
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.629
She goes there every Friday...

682
00:51:46.629 --> 00:51:47.769
buying all the cartoon figures.

683
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.340
It suits her really well.

684
00:51:51.809 --> 00:51:54.010
Speaking of Itaewon,

685
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.939
let's go clubbing tonight. What about men's night out?

686
00:51:56.439 --> 00:51:58.309
- Club? - Club?

687
00:51:58.309 --> 00:52:01.550
Yes, club! What will you do with your body? Make use of it.

688
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.649
You should enjoy it when you can as you're still single.

689
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:06.749
Have you been to clubs a lot?

690
00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:09.220
No, I have never been.

691
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.010
My ears are going to bleed!

692
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.280
I didn't know it's like this here.

693
00:52:34.419 --> 00:52:36.379
My eyes are going to bleed.

694
00:52:46.629 --> 00:52:49.729
Let's all go out and dance on the stage.

695
00:52:49.729 --> 00:52:50.870
What?

696
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.470
- No, no. - You should go first.

697
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.140
I'll go downstairs first. You two come down too.

698
00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.910
- Yes. - We'll follow you.

699
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:59.070
I'll go down first.

700
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.169
Okay.

701
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.749
I'll get over you.

702
00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.749
I'll get over you, Ho Rang!

703
00:53:11.289 --> 00:53:13.550
I'll get over you!

704
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.280
That guy?

705
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.680
What is that guy doing there?

706
00:54:10.879 --> 00:54:12.149
Bo Mi!

707
00:54:13.379 --> 00:54:15.519
Come down!

708
00:54:15.979 --> 00:54:18.189
I'm too scared.

709
00:54:18.189 --> 00:54:20.919
Do you want to go to an internet cafe? Let's go.

710
00:54:23.919 --> 00:54:27.959
You said you had an appointment.

711
00:54:29.729 --> 00:54:33.070
We talk with our bodies on the stage.

712
00:54:34.539 --> 00:54:35.640
Bodies?

713
00:54:53.653 --> 00:54:56.124
Se Hee,

714
00:54:56.423 --> 00:54:59.934
can I ask you two favors?

715
00:55:00.633 --> 00:55:05.503
Could you let Ji Ho write...

716
00:55:06.334 --> 00:55:09.104
when she asks you if she can?

717
00:55:09.874 --> 00:55:13.044
Could you please...

718
00:55:14.184 --> 00:55:17.383
make her fulfill her dream...

719
00:55:18.713 --> 00:55:20.624
as a writer and...

720
00:55:21.454 --> 00:55:23.084
not live like her own mom?

721
00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:35.834
(Ko Jung Min)

722
00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.144
Hello?

723
00:56:00.994 --> 00:56:02.664
(Writing Contract)

724
00:56:10.463 --> 00:56:13.503
(Korean authors, Foreign authors)

725
00:56:24.454 --> 00:56:28.983
Excuse me. Do you happen to have this book?

726
00:56:28.983 --> 00:56:30.354
("Although Nothing Will Change Even If You Cry")

727
00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:33.294
There was only one left in our stock and it was sold.

728
00:56:35.224 --> 00:56:36.423
Thank you.

729
00:56:44.474 --> 00:56:45.573
Yes.

730
00:56:46.434 --> 00:56:49.173
Hello, Father.

731
00:56:58.284 --> 00:57:01.423
You beat him up pretty hard.

732
00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:05.323
Will it be disadvantageous...

733
00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:07.994
to Ji Ho?

734
00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.564
I think it'll be fine.

735
00:57:12.463 --> 00:57:15.264
I met the CEO of his production company just now.

736
00:57:16.363 --> 00:57:19.704
We know each other. He won't make this bigger.

737
00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.403
Okay. Thank you.

738
00:57:28.213 --> 00:57:29.314
Well...

739
00:57:31.483 --> 00:57:33.314
The fact that I'm Ji Ho's husband...

740
00:57:34.553 --> 00:57:38.124
Will it affect you...

741
00:57:39.854 --> 00:57:41.423
in working with her?

742
00:57:42.593 --> 00:57:45.534
Is that why you're here?

743
00:57:47.903 --> 00:57:49.834
Are you worried I might ruin her work...

744
00:57:51.204 --> 00:57:53.503
because of the grudges from my old love?

745
00:57:54.544 --> 00:57:55.704
That I might harm her?

746
00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:57.573
Yes.

747
00:58:06.753 --> 00:58:08.184
When I got married,

748
00:58:08.954 --> 00:58:11.323
Ji Ho's mother asked me for this favor.

749
00:58:13.593 --> 00:58:16.124
She asked me to let her write...

750
00:58:17.064 --> 00:58:19.693
when she wants to begin her writing again...

751
00:58:21.704 --> 00:58:25.403
so that she doesn't give up on her dream.

752
00:58:26.434 --> 00:58:27.644
She asked me that.

753
00:58:30.644 --> 00:58:34.414
But I didn't know what to do,

754
00:58:36.584 --> 00:58:39.814
so I only promised her that I wouldn't be any harm to her.

755
00:58:42.084 --> 00:58:43.284
But...

756
00:58:45.923 --> 00:58:47.264
you know.

757
00:58:48.394 --> 00:58:49.564
You know...

758
00:58:50.934 --> 00:58:54.003
how to make her not give up on her dream.

759
00:58:58.303 --> 00:59:02.104
So you came to see me.

760
00:59:03.403 --> 00:59:06.414
You met your old love after 12 years,

761
00:59:07.584 --> 00:59:09.113
and is that what you have to say?

762
00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:13.213
I'm a bit upset.

763
00:59:15.523 --> 00:59:16.653
Sorry.

764
00:59:18.854 --> 00:59:20.093
But...

765
00:59:20.894 --> 00:59:23.264
there's really nothing I can do.

766
00:59:25.133 --> 00:59:27.363
I found out...

767
00:59:28.303 --> 00:59:29.863
why she gave up on writing today.

768
00:59:31.273 --> 00:59:33.943
The only thing I could do was throwing punches at him.

769
00:59:36.974 --> 00:59:38.773
I heard you're a good producer.

770
00:59:42.343 --> 00:59:43.414
Jung Min.

771
00:59:45.584 --> 00:59:47.053
Don't treat her as my wife,

772
00:59:48.124 --> 00:59:49.753
but as a writer,

773
00:59:51.193 --> 00:59:52.323
please.

774
00:59:58.564 --> 01:00:01.034
"Words are born from people's mouths..."

775
01:00:02.604 --> 01:00:04.573
"and die in their ears."

776
01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:11.943
("Although Nothing Will Change Even If You Cry")

777
01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:17.584
"But some words don't die."

778
01:00:18.184 --> 01:00:19.684
(Don't ever love again. You don't have the right to.)

779
01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:21.923
"They go into people's hearts..."

780
01:00:23.084 --> 01:00:24.494
"and survive."

781
01:00:26.593 --> 01:00:30.064
These words survived in my heart for 12 years.

782
01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.434
When did they disappear...

783
01:00:33.494 --> 01:00:35.463
so suddenly like this?

784
01:00:36.664 --> 01:00:38.303
I couldn't get rid of them...

785
01:00:39.633 --> 01:00:41.374
from my heart...

786
01:00:42.544 --> 01:00:44.113
no matter how hard I tried then.

787
01:00:49.284 --> 01:00:50.854
I have something to ask too.

788
01:00:54.053 --> 01:00:55.253
Have you...

789
01:00:56.023 --> 01:00:58.224
ever professed to Ms. Yoon before?

790
01:01:02.394 --> 01:01:03.523
What?

791
01:01:04.264 --> 01:01:05.434
Profession.

792
01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:09.363
That you like her.

793
01:01:11.073 --> 01:01:12.073
Or...

794
01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:16.204
something like that. Have you?

795
01:01:18.673 --> 01:01:22.514
I don't think it's necessary to express it with words.

796
01:01:22.684 --> 01:01:23.684
So you haven't.

797
01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.113
You know what?

798
01:01:27.153 --> 01:01:28.684
You never...

799
01:01:29.584 --> 01:01:31.454
did it to me either.

800
01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.093
You never said you liked me.

801
01:01:42.503 --> 01:01:44.503
-Bye. -Bye.

802
01:01:47.244 --> 01:01:48.474
Do you know...

803
01:01:50.544 --> 01:01:52.773
words can survive only when they reach people's hearts?

804
01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:58.014
You have to say it out loud for them to reach others' hearts.

805
01:01:59.713 --> 01:02:01.454
It wasn't a coincidence.

806
01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:08.463
So from now on,

807
01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.834
don't draw a line...

808
01:02:13.564 --> 01:02:14.834
on purpose.

809
01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:17.403
It was because of her words.

810
01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:21.144
I believe it's no one's fault.

811
01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:26.644
Just like some of those waves keep on flowing...

812
01:02:27.914 --> 01:02:31.213
while the others break.

813
01:02:34.954 --> 01:02:36.784
That's how it is.

814
01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:38.894
So...

815
01:02:40.093 --> 01:02:44.034
Her warm words piled up in my heart.

816
01:02:44.764 --> 01:02:46.164
Se Hee,

817
01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:49.403
don't worry too much.

818
01:02:52.573 --> 01:02:54.443
Just because you lived yesterday,

819
01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:57.644
it doesn't mean you know everything...

820
01:02:58.914 --> 01:03:00.273
about today.

821
01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:06.653
Her words have survived...

822
01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:10.693
(Us)

823
01:03:10.693 --> 01:03:11.994
in my dead heart.

824
01:03:11.994 --> 01:03:15.323
(Us)

825
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.463
Do you still work part-time?

826
01:03:21.704 --> 01:03:22.863
Oh, yes.

827
01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.874
But I think I'll quit soon.

828
01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.544
That's nice to hear.

829
01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:31.843
Well...

830
01:03:32.974 --> 01:03:36.414
Once I quit this job, I plan to write again.

831
01:03:38.184 --> 01:03:40.514
What do you mean?

832
01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:42.653
That drama?

833
01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:45.823
Yes.

834
01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:48.423
I thought you quit writing...

835
01:03:48.994 --> 01:03:50.564
to focus on housekeeping.

836
01:03:51.733 --> 01:03:53.394
Yes, but...

837
01:03:54.233 --> 01:03:56.363
I got a nice opportunity,

838
01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:59.034
so I plan to begin writing again.

839
01:04:00.334 --> 01:04:01.443
What about a baby then?

840
01:04:02.374 --> 01:04:03.374
Pardon?

841
01:04:03.443 --> 01:04:05.213
When will you give birth?

842
01:04:09.443 --> 01:04:11.113
I'm not sure.

843
01:04:12.213 --> 01:04:15.153
I mean, work is important, but you should consider that too.

844
01:04:16.023 --> 01:04:18.923
You're still young, but Se Hee is not.

845
01:04:26.794 --> 01:04:28.503
Pay back his loan with this.

846
01:04:28.834 --> 01:04:31.403
Use the rest for housekeeping when you have a baby.

847
01:04:32.974 --> 01:04:35.374
- What? - I promised to give this money...

848
01:04:35.773 --> 01:04:36.943
when he got married.

849
01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:44.184
I don't think I should take this.

850
01:04:45.153 --> 01:04:46.354
Then who else?

851
01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.954
Of course, you should give this to Se Hee directly.

852
01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:53.354
We won't be able to talk.

853
01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:56.693
And he won't take it either. It's right for you to take it.

854
01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.604
It's important for you to be a bridge between family members...

855
01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:02.204
as his wife.

856
01:05:05.003 --> 01:05:06.204
Let's go.

857
01:05:06.534 --> 01:05:07.773
Father.

858
01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:16.014
I have something to say.

859
01:05:17.199 --> 01:05:18.728
It's cold, so go home safely.

860
01:05:40.688 --> 01:05:42.618
Where are you? Why aren't you coming?

861
01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.658
I'll go in shortly.

862
01:05:44.919 --> 01:05:47.129
Do you realize what time it is now? Come home already!

863
01:05:47.129 --> 01:05:48.759
Hey, I'm not a child.

864
01:05:49.058 --> 01:05:50.998
Don't overact, silly.

865
01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:53.768
See you later.

866
01:05:53.799 --> 01:05:56.069
- Stop being... - A mom?

867
01:05:57.899 --> 01:05:59.938
She seems happy though.

868
01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:03.779
Cheers!

869
01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.078
Soo Ji.

870
01:06:11.949 --> 01:06:13.679
Do you know the movie, "The Graduate"?

871
01:06:14.118 --> 01:06:17.049
Of course. Isn't that your favorite movie?

872
01:06:18.719 --> 01:06:20.958
I've seen it more than 10 times.

873
01:06:21.328 --> 01:06:24.129
When I first saw it, I was in my 10th grade.

874
01:06:24.528 --> 01:06:27.828
I fell for Ben when he went to Elaine's wedding...

875
01:06:28.969 --> 01:06:31.339
and ran away with her.

876
01:06:32.599 --> 01:06:33.738
It looked really romantic...

877
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:39.208
to this 17-year-old girl.

878
01:06:39.939 --> 01:06:42.748
That's the most famous part of the movie, right?

879
01:06:43.948 --> 01:06:45.049
However,

880
01:06:46.278 --> 01:06:48.948
when I watched that movie again in my 20s,

881
01:06:49.889 --> 01:06:51.389
I could see many other things about the movie.

882
01:06:54.429 --> 01:06:55.559
Like what?

883
01:06:56.658 --> 01:06:58.299
Their faces after running out of the wedding venue.

884
01:07:01.828 --> 01:07:06.368
They ran away from the wedding with full of excitement.

885
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:10.269
But somehow, they become speechless after getting on the bus.

886
01:07:12.439 --> 01:07:15.208
It looks like they are anxious and don't know what to do.

887
01:07:16.479 --> 01:07:18.379
I couldn't see that when I was young.

888
01:07:21.089 --> 01:07:23.448
But I can see that now.

889
01:07:28.528 --> 01:07:29.689
Why?

890
01:07:30.599 --> 01:07:31.998
Is it something you can see...

891
01:07:32.099 --> 01:07:34.429
between you and your landlord?

892
01:07:43.879 --> 01:07:45.009
Is it hard for you?

893
01:07:51.419 --> 01:07:52.519
Yes, it is.

894
01:08:09.769 --> 01:08:10.868
Hello.

895
01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:13.439
Now?

896
01:08:14.868 --> 01:08:16.009
Okay.

897
01:08:19.139 --> 01:08:20.849
It's really cold now.

898
01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:22.908
You should go now.

899
01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:25.948
Don't worry about me.

900
01:08:27.318 --> 01:08:29.419
You can go now. Mr. Ma is waiting for you.

901
01:08:30.519 --> 01:08:33.189
Text me when you get home.

902
01:08:48.839 --> 01:08:51.479
What's going on? Are you okay?

903
01:08:51.639 --> 01:08:53.408
What's wrong?

904
01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:56.309
Did you do something to Mr. Park?

905
01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:58.479
Well, your way didn't work out well.

906
01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.179
So I figured my own way out.

907
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.648
What did you do?

908
01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.488
I punched him in the face.

909
01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:07.828
What?

910
01:09:08.389 --> 01:09:10.828
Well done. Come here!

911
01:09:13.868 --> 01:09:14.969
Come here!

912
01:09:22.568 --> 01:09:24.879
I realized it when I found love.

913
01:09:26.009 --> 01:09:28.248
The reason our marriage happened easily was...

914
01:09:30.078 --> 01:09:32.919
because we were not in love.

915
01:09:33.748 --> 01:09:36.889
I will pay for the half of your dress expense.

916
01:09:36.889 --> 01:09:39.919
It's okay. It didn't cost me that much anyway.

917
01:09:39.919 --> 01:09:43.158
But you even had to pay for the shoes and the bouquet.

918
01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:45.799
I will deduct those expenses from your next month's rent.

919
01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.169
Marriage should happen when you are in love.

920
01:09:50.068 --> 01:09:51.169
But why...

921
01:09:51.498 --> 01:09:53.939
(Inseong Bank)

922
01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:57.038
When are you going to give birth?

923
01:09:59.009 --> 01:10:01.078
Am I getting hurt more...

924
01:10:01.879 --> 01:10:04.519
when I'm in love with him?

925
01:10:14.129 --> 01:10:16.158
Have you told Ji Ho you like her?

926
01:10:16.488 --> 01:10:20.129
Do you know that you actually have to say it to let her know?

927
01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:23.868
You have to speak it out. That's the only way it will reach her heart.

928
01:10:25.398 --> 01:10:28.439
I know. It's really awkward.

929
01:10:30.738 --> 01:10:32.208
But it looks better...

930
01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:35.208
than I expected.

931
01:10:38.919 --> 01:10:40.049
Let's do it well...

932
01:10:41.519 --> 01:10:42.748
today.

933
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.809
Have you been to Soo Ji's place?

934
01:11:05.738 --> 01:11:09.509
Yes. I had beer with her.

935
01:11:10.748 --> 01:11:12.049
I see.

936
01:11:27.998 --> 01:11:31.398
Did you sign the contract today?

937
01:11:32.498 --> 01:11:33.599
I did.

938
01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:37.408
She's such a nice person.

939
01:11:38.078 --> 01:11:39.179
I see.

940
01:11:40.608 --> 01:11:41.708
That's good to know.

941
01:11:46.379 --> 01:11:48.589
You look very tired.

942
01:11:49.788 --> 01:11:52.919
I'm exhausted.

943
01:11:53.828 --> 01:11:54.988
It's pretty bad today.

944
01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:10.408
Kitty, you are welcoming us today.

945
01:12:14.979 --> 01:12:18.049
I have something to tell you.

946
01:12:18.379 --> 01:12:22.948
I have something to tell you too.

947
01:12:34.129 --> 01:12:35.868
Can she not see this well?

948
01:13:01.059 --> 01:13:02.488
- I want to... - We...

949
01:13:06.398 --> 01:13:07.898
You can tell me first.

950
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:11.639
Okay. So...

951
01:13:12.799 --> 01:13:14.139
Can we...

952
01:13:21.809 --> 01:13:24.618
Never mind. You can tell me first.

953
01:13:28.919 --> 01:13:30.248
I would like to...

954
01:13:34.089 --> 01:13:35.358
end our...

955
01:13:40.028 --> 01:13:42.328
contract now.

956
01:13:45.969 --> 01:13:49.009
Words are always...

957
01:13:51.979 --> 01:13:53.238
slower than...

958
01:13:58.748 --> 01:13:59.948
the heart.

959
01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:23.879
(Because This Is My First Life)

960
01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:28.509
The more the love deepened, the more confused I got.

961
01:14:29.509 --> 01:14:30.778
Isn't that Ho Rang?

962
01:14:30.778 --> 01:14:32.748
She looked like a shivering chick in the morning.

963
01:14:32.748 --> 01:14:35.889
Which sentence is the least corny if I want to tell her my feelings?

964
01:14:36.089 --> 01:14:38.719
Who could be Mr. Ma's friend's friend's friend?

965
01:14:39.059 --> 01:14:42.028
It's me. Do you want to go on a date with me?

966
01:14:44.059 --> 01:14:46.398
What do you think marriage is?

967
01:14:47.429 --> 01:14:49.099
Do you have any idea, Se Hee?

968
01:14:49.498 --> 01:14:53.169
Getting married when you are in love must be happy, right?

969
01:14:53.368 --> 01:14:56.809
(Us)
