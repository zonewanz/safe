00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.475
(Episode 35)

2
00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:30.725
- Hyun Soo. - I thought I'd never get to see...

3
00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:19.695
I went to Paris after receiving Alain Passard's mail.

4
00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.165
After we broke up.

5
00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.236
I missed you so much.

6
00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.505
After you left...

7
00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:34.616
I won the contest, but I wasn't happy.

8
00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:38.086
It was what I really wanted.

9
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:41.616
But because you weren't there,

10
00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.556
I wasn't happy.

11
00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:48.496
Do you know how I endured in Paris?

12
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.265
Do you remember when we went to Beolgyo?

13
00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.436
Yes.

14
00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:57.206
I kept the train ticket from then.

15
00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:02.406
I put the ticket on my locker and thought of you.

16
00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:05.906
That's how I endured each day.

17
00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:10.646
I went to Paris to find you.

18
00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:13.415
Really?

19
00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:15.056
Yes.

20
00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:19.085
I went to L'Arpege,

21
00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:23.426
but they said you moved to a different restaurant.

22
00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:27.965
I was afraid...

23
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.905
that I wouldn't be able to see you again if I left.

24
00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:34.635
I drove without knowing your departure time.

25
00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:50.986
(Temperature of Love)

26
00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:58.565
(Hwangbo Kyung)

27
00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:01.395
Hello.

28
00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:03.936
I'm calling you to ask a question.

29
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.976
Did you have a meeting yesterday...

30
00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:08.335
with Hyun Soo?

31
00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:09.876
Why do you ask?

32
00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:12.306
I can't get a hold of her,

33
00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:13.815
and she hasn't come home.

34
00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:15.976
I'll be there.

35
00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:50.186
Aren't you hungry?

36
00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.945
No, I'm not hungry.

37
00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:55.056
Come on, you have to get up.

38
00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:58.955
What's all this?

39
00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:00.856
Sit down.

40
00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:01.895
Amazing.

41
00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:04.765
- Did you make this? - Yes

42
00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:06.025
It took me an hour.

43
00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:09.166
It's so pretty.

44
00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:19.876
It's so delicious.

45
00:06:22.575 --> 00:06:24.215
Are you not going to Hong Kong then?

46
00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:26.885
I won't go if you tell me not to go.

47
00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.085
That reminds me of the time...

48
00:06:30.126 --> 00:06:32.025
when Alain Passard contacted you.

49
00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.796
I don't want you to go.

50
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:44.806
Isn't it delicious?

51
00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:46.775
Yes, it is.

52
00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:54.346
Be careful when you go down.

53
00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:55.515
I'm fine.

54
00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.515
Don't scare me like that.

55
00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.025
You...

56
00:07:12.596 --> 00:07:13.736
See you next time.

57
00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.195
See you later.

58
00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:26.676
- Hasn't she called yet? - No.

59
00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:27.916
Did you call anyone?

60
00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:29.616
I didn't call her parents...

61
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.986
because I didn't want them to worry.

62
00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:34.455
She might come home soon, so I didn't want to make a fuss.

63
00:07:38.455 --> 00:07:40.195
- Hyun Soo. - Hey.

64
00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:46.126
Mr. Park, you're here.

65
00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.496
He's been worried about you.

66
00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:52.705
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.905
I'll go upstairs and get changed.

68
00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:25.166
Hello, Mr. Park.

69
00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:27.676
Hello.

70
00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:29.536
I'm sorry,

71
00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:31.606
but we're totally booked for both lunch and dinner.

72
00:08:31.976 --> 00:08:33.316
Would you like some tea?

73
00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:38.045
No, it's okay. I dropped in because I was in the area.

74
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.645
Jung Woo.

75
00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.185
What brings you here?

76
00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.226
Didn't you leave for Hong Kong yet?

77
00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:21.496
Something came up.

78
00:09:24.466 --> 00:09:25.466
Bye.

79
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.145
Were you with Chef On?

80
00:09:42.746 --> 00:09:43.785
Yes.

81
00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:45.346
"Yes"?

82
00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.856
Why are you staring? You're embarrassing me.

83
00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:50.525
Are you guys back together?

84
00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.025
I don't think I can live without him.

85
00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:55.626
Goodness.

86
00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:59.696
I shouldn't have called Mr. Park.

87
00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:02.566
I thought something happened to you,

88
00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:05.106
so I called Mr. Park, naturally.

89
00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:09.606
He seemed really shocked when you came in.

90
00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:13.746
I shouldn't have... It's all my fault.

91
00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:16.216
I feel bad for him.

92
00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:28.196
(Three missed calls)

93
00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:30.866
(Voice mail)

94
00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:35.665
First message.

95
00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:38.165
Why did you turn your phone off?

96
00:10:39.035 --> 00:10:40.135
Turn it on, and call me.

97
00:10:48.246 --> 00:10:50.086
He's been worried about you.

98
00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:53.086
I'll go upstairs and get changed.

99
00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:05.096
(Lee Hyun Soo)

100
00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:10.236
(Lee Hyun Soo)

101
00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:28.685
(From Park Jung Woo)

102
00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:47.535
I bought it because I thought this would look good on you.

103
00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:49.135
Sincerely, Park Jung Woo.

104
00:11:51.976 --> 00:11:52.976
You're home.

105
00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:56.816
I see it's a hat.

106
00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:58.415
Goodness.

107
00:11:58.716 --> 00:11:59.755
What's wrong?

108
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.716
I don't know. I really like Mr. Park.

109
00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:05.586
He's a really nice person.

110
00:12:05.856 --> 00:12:07.856
He's stable and warm-hearted.

111
00:12:07.996 --> 00:12:10.196
I'll be good to him if he marries Hyun Soo.

112
00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:12.826
It'd be a win-win situation.

113
00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:14.696
There's no point in saying that.

114
00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:17.106
Hyun Soo is the one who would be living with him.

115
00:12:18.765 --> 00:12:20.005
I know that.

116
00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:23.706
They're taken aback because you didn't arrive...

117
00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:25.706
in Hong Kong yesterday.

118
00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:28.246
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:31.346
Why did you do that?

120
00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:33.755
I have a woman I love.

121
00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:36.385
The moment I was about to leave,

122
00:12:37.685 --> 00:12:38.956
I realized that...

123
00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:41.496
I might lose her if I left.

124
00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:43.265
I don't understand.

125
00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:46.836
You can meet her every time you come to Korea.

126
00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:48.566
How can you give up on your career for that?

127
00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:52.535
Six months is a very short time in your life.

128
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.505
Is it that hard for you to endure that?

129
00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:57.376
I've already lost her once recently.

130
00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:00.045
I don't want to be apart from her even for a while.

131
00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:03.946
I'll take every single disadvantage you decide to give me.

132
00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:05.785
I'll bear with whatever you decide to give me.

133
00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:09.155
Love.

134
00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:11.185
You're going to...

135
00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:14.196
give up on your career for love?

136
00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:18.566
I'm not surprised.

137
00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:30.775
Where do you want to go? My drama's going to air any day now.

138
00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:33.116
Let's go get some fresh air. It'll help you write better.

139
00:13:35.446 --> 00:13:36.515
Let's go.

140
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:56.539
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E35 Temperature of Love "I Don't Wanna You To Go"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

141
00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:13.856
It's beautiful.

142
00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:22.596
Cheers.

143
00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:31.435
This tastes really familiar.

144
00:14:32.535 --> 00:14:34.635
- Am I wrong? - You're right.

145
00:14:35.905 --> 00:14:36.946
Where did I drink this?

146
00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:38.905
You drank it with truffle.

147
00:14:40.275 --> 00:14:41.415
That's right.

148
00:14:43.486 --> 00:14:47.116
Every time I drank this in Paris, I got reminded of that day.

149
00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:51.856
Good Soup's going to hold a special event for Christmas,

150
00:14:51.856 --> 00:14:53.696
and we're going to give it to the customers for free.

151
00:14:58.866 --> 00:15:00.466
That's a great gesture.

152
00:15:04.606 --> 00:15:06.165
I decided not to go to Hong Kong.

153
00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:09.505
Is that okay?

154
00:15:10.106 --> 00:15:11.775
Normally, it's not.

155
00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:14.376
But I think I might lose...

156
00:15:14.816 --> 00:15:18.415
the most important thing in my life if I leave right now.

157
00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:21.915
Does that mean we're starting over again?

158
00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:25.685
The initial problem that made us break up...

159
00:15:26.555 --> 00:15:28.956
hasn't been solved yet.

160
00:15:31.326 --> 00:15:33.696
Most couples get back together...

161
00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:37.135
and break up because of the same reason.

162
00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.606
Then let's make a promise before we get back together.

163
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.405
What promise?

164
00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:46.316
Let's not break up.

165
00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:16.805
(I was too scared to break up with you face-to-face.)

166
00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:18.106
(P.S. I got annoyed because you asked me for money.)

167
00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:25.645
I was too scared to break up with you face-to-face.

168
00:16:27.216 --> 00:16:30.385
P.S. I got annoyed because you asked me for money.

169
00:16:32.255 --> 00:16:33.496
This jerk.

170
00:16:38.826 --> 00:16:40.295
He never even gave me any money.

171
00:16:45.535 --> 00:16:46.805
(Job Application)

172
00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:50.606
(What made you choose our company?)

173
00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:55.015
- Yes, Mr. Park. - Are these all the applications...

174
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.145
for the new recruits?

175
00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:58.545
Give me everything. I'll take a look at all of them.

176
00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.046
Mr. Park.

177
00:17:27.675 --> 00:17:31.086
Should I cancel your morning schedule if you're too tired?

178
00:17:35.256 --> 00:17:36.356
No.

179
00:17:38.126 --> 00:17:39.286
Is this what you want?

180
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.796
No, this is what I want.

181
00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:45.126
- That's meaningless. - Then...

182
00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:49.435
- What about this? - This will lead our drama to fail.

183
00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.606
Director Kim.

184
00:17:50.606 --> 00:17:53.306
What? I shaved my beard, but I'm not even getting anything.

185
00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:54.405
Did we have to give you something?

186
00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:57.306
Were you expecting something from us for shaving your beard?

187
00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.276
Do you have good news or something?

188
00:18:00.816 --> 00:18:02.846
Of course, she does.

189
00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:05.846
She got back together with Chef On.

190
00:18:05.846 --> 00:18:09.116
My gosh, I'm pretty sure you guys are going to break up again.

191
00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:11.126
Why are you cursing our relationship?

192
00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:13.155
I'm just telling you the truth. That's what happened to me.

193
00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:15.126
That's just what happened to you.

194
00:18:15.126 --> 00:18:17.965
You have a knack for showing off what you've experienced.

195
00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:20.596
- None of them are good ones anyway. - You're the best, Kyung.

196
00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:23.705
I'm going to go.

197
00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:25.066
Are you upset?

198
00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:27.876
I'm going to ask Jung Woo to help us with our drama.

199
00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:31.276
I live a very diligent life even if you guys make fun of me.

200
00:18:31.705 --> 00:18:34.046
When did we ever make fun of you?

201
00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:36.846
No one cares for you as much as we do.

202
00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:39.915
- My gosh, you startled me. - I shaved my beard.

203
00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:41.756
What do you want me to do?

204
00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:44.455
He wants you to kiss him.

205
00:18:44.856 --> 00:18:46.126
That's not what I meant.

206
00:18:48.895 --> 00:18:49.965
Hey.

207
00:18:52.925 --> 00:18:53.995
It's because she was startled.

208
00:19:00.735 --> 00:19:03.645
Jung Woo, I just had a meeting with Hyun Soo regarding our casting.

209
00:19:04.306 --> 00:19:06.876
Can you contact the actors for us?

210
00:19:07.445 --> 00:19:09.145
Do I owe you stuff?

211
00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:11.316
You always ask me for favors.

212
00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:12.786
That's because I know you'll do them for me.

213
00:19:17.826 --> 00:19:19.026
About Hyun Soo...

214
00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:21.126
Yes?

215
00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.326
Why do you think...

216
00:19:25.495 --> 00:19:27.235
I thought she was mine?

217
00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:31.405
You dealt with love like business.

218
00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:35.106
That's how you do business. You wait until the right timing.

219
00:19:35.106 --> 00:19:37.945
I heard Chef On asked her out when they first met each other.

220
00:19:38.905 --> 00:19:40.776
You should gone after her back then.

221
00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.376
Then...

222
00:19:42.945 --> 00:19:44.715
things might've turned out differently.

223
00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:53.425
I have a previous engagement.

224
00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:57.965
It was nice to meet you.

225
00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.796
I'm sorry. I don't feel comfortable enough.

226
00:20:05.665 --> 00:20:06.735
Hey.

227
00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:11.776
I'm sorry, Jung Woo.

228
00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.316
She'll definitely become a writer.

229
00:20:14.116 --> 00:20:15.215
She's rude.

230
00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:20.516
Wait.

231
00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.195
You're quite rude.

232
00:20:28.556 --> 00:20:29.826
You may be my college senior,

233
00:20:30.026 --> 00:20:32.326
but you can't just talk to me comfortably when we just met.

234
00:20:32.796 --> 00:20:35.096
We didn't just meet. We met earlier in my office.

235
00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:38.165
What do you want?

236
00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:40.735
Why did you refuse to shake my hand?

237
00:20:41.735 --> 00:20:44.876
I talked to you comfortably because you were rude to me first.

238
00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:52.145
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:54.556
I had a bad day.

240
00:20:55.415 --> 00:20:57.026
I like that you're quick to apologize.

241
00:20:57.526 --> 00:20:59.155
You can talk to me comfortably.

242
00:21:00.126 --> 00:21:02.056
I also like that you're quick to adapt.

243
00:21:04.695 --> 00:21:07.135
Joon Ha gave me your script, so I read it.

244
00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:09.096
You read my script?

245
00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:11.306
I don't just offer jobs out of nowhere.

246
00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:12.405
How was it?

247
00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:14.175
You must like free stuff.

248
00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.376
Are you expecting me to tell you that for free?

249
00:21:17.445 --> 00:21:19.816
No. When are you free?

250
00:21:28.685 --> 00:21:30.925
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

251
00:21:39.326 --> 00:21:42.066
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

252
00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:47.606
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

253
00:22:00.816 --> 00:22:02.455
If we can't get our first choice of casting,

254
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.485
I'll be understanding just until our second choice.

255
00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:08.356
You talk as if I'm fully responsible for the casting.

256
00:22:08.356 --> 00:22:09.866
You also have a share of responsibility.

257
00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:13.135
I'm a rookie writer. You're a popular director.

258
00:22:13.495 --> 00:22:14.796
Who do you think will be more responsible?

259
00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:19.735
All the other dramas will want to cast these people as well.

260
00:22:19.735 --> 00:22:21.876
Do you know how many dramas are being made right now?

261
00:22:22.076 --> 00:22:24.205
What difference is that going to make?

262
00:22:24.546 --> 00:22:26.245
In the end, it's just a competition.

263
00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:29.046
And the actors will want to appear in the most successful drama.

264
00:22:29.846 --> 00:22:31.346
You're so good with words.

265
00:22:31.546 --> 00:22:33.556
Now, let's hurry up, and get ready.

266
00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.985
Our competitors are already on the move.

267
00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:38.056
Okay, let's do this.

268
00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:44.866
Mr. Park isn't in his office.

269
00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:48.995
When is he coming back?

270
00:22:49.165 --> 00:22:51.635
He canceled all of his appointments and went to Daegu.

271
00:22:53.506 --> 00:22:55.536
It's a very important period for me.

272
00:22:55.536 --> 00:22:57.245
He can't take the day off like this.

273
00:23:02.215 --> 00:23:03.786
I need to stay focused.

274
00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:06.286
All I have right now is work.

275
00:23:34.645 --> 00:23:36.616
In 1, 2. There.

276
00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.485
Like this. I'll do it.

277
00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:47.126
Why can't I get better at this?

278
00:23:50.895 --> 00:23:52.866
(Hong Ah)

279
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.336
Hello?

280
00:23:56.066 --> 00:23:57.635
Won Joon, I got into an accident.

281
00:23:58.266 --> 00:24:00.475
What? Where are you right now?

282
00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:04.046
Soo Jung, I'll be right back. I need to go to the hospital.

283
00:24:14.756 --> 00:24:15.985
Won Joon.

284
00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:33.036
You didn't get hurt.

285
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:36.346
No. Did I say I was hurt?

286
00:24:40.776 --> 00:24:41.846
Did I startle you?

287
00:24:47.685 --> 00:24:50.856
(Emergency Medical Center)

288
00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:53.756
I have my car with me. I'll give you a ride.

289
00:24:58.425 --> 00:25:01.366
I guess you're never going to treat me with sincerity.

290
00:25:02.695 --> 00:25:04.536
What do you mean?

291
00:25:05.405 --> 00:25:06.975
I really got into an accident.

292
00:25:07.175 --> 00:25:09.376
And I called you at that moment because you popped into my head.

293
00:25:09.576 --> 00:25:11.205
Was that such a wrong thing to do?

294
00:25:11.905 --> 00:25:13.276
Why are you angry at me?

295
00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:15.245
You're the one who started liking someone else.

296
00:25:16.046 --> 00:25:17.745
Were you ever planning on liking me back?

297
00:25:18.915 --> 00:25:20.556
You were like food to me.

298
00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:23.256
What more is important in life than food?

299
00:25:23.985 --> 00:25:25.026
Before,

300
00:25:25.955 --> 00:25:28.225
the fact that I was next to you was enough to make me happy.

301
00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:30.326
But I don't feel that way anymore.

302
00:25:32.096 --> 00:25:33.495
I want to be loved too.

303
00:26:08.096 --> 00:26:11.336
(Yoo Hong Jin)

304
00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:15.975
Hey, Mr. Yoo.

305
00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:19.046
Joon Ha says he wants to outsource the camera team,

306
00:26:19.346 --> 00:26:20.645
but it's too expensive.

307
00:26:20.945 --> 00:26:22.715
We won't be able to provide the production fee.

308
00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:26.485
Then we won't be able to carry on with that either.

309
00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:32.126
(Secretary Kim Mi Jin)

310
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:35.495
- Yes? - SBC just called and asked about...

311
00:26:35.495 --> 00:26:37.266
the publication rights for exporting a drama.

312
00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:38.925
Should I schedule a meeting with them?

313
00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:40.965
Tell them I'm abroad on a business trip.

314
00:27:08.895 --> 00:27:09.965
It looks delicious.

315
00:27:28.316 --> 00:27:32.116
I came because you seduced me with food.

316
00:27:32.116 --> 00:27:35.455
Good job. All you do is stay at home and work all day.

317
00:27:36.256 --> 00:27:37.786
I don't know if this is a good idea.

318
00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:50.306
I love the ambiance.

319
00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:54.106
Choose a genre. Do you want romance, action, science fiction,

320
00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:55.506
cartoon, horror, thriller...

321
00:27:55.506 --> 00:27:56.506
I want romance.

322
00:28:02.576 --> 00:28:03.645
Good.

323
00:28:04.915 --> 00:28:06.116
Any emails today?

324
00:28:07.715 --> 00:28:10.725
Just a couple from your credit card company.

325
00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.995
Oh, okay. Good.

326
00:28:14.925 --> 00:28:16.195
- So I was thinking... - I want to just...

327
00:28:17.066 --> 00:28:19.965
- Sorry. - I'm sorry. You can go first.

328
00:28:20.235 --> 00:28:21.465
What were you going to say?

329
00:28:22.336 --> 00:28:23.766
You have a weird appetite.

330
00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:25.036
It's delicious.

331
00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:27.506
- Try some. - What?

332
00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:31.145
Yes. But there's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all.

333
00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:34.276
I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying...

334
00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:38.586
- It's not bad. - I told you.

335
00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:42.586
(Jung Sun's mother)

336
00:28:47.856 --> 00:28:49.596
It's your mother. Should I pick up?

337
00:28:50.566 --> 00:28:51.665
Do you want to?

338
00:28:52.326 --> 00:28:53.366
Yes.

339
00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:55.766
Then pick up.

340
00:29:01.675 --> 00:29:02.776
Hello?

341
00:29:03.145 --> 00:29:06.145
Are you busy? It took you a while to pick up.

342
00:29:07.316 --> 00:29:08.715
I'm not busy. We can talk.

343
00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:11.046
You told me that...

344
00:29:11.415 --> 00:29:13.655
you and I can keep seeing each other.

345
00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:15.356
Yes.

346
00:29:16.725 --> 00:29:18.056
I need a friend.

347
00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.826
Mother, I'll call you right back. Would that be okay?

348
00:29:25.066 --> 00:29:26.635
Don't make me wait for too long.

349
00:29:27.536 --> 00:29:28.536
Okay.

350
00:29:33.306 --> 00:29:35.076
Your mother wants to meet.

351
00:29:35.475 --> 00:29:36.846
Why does she want to meet?

352
00:29:38.346 --> 00:29:41.516
Your mother probably thinks we're still broken up.

353
00:29:41.975 --> 00:29:45.016
That means she's solely my friend now.

354
00:29:45.745 --> 00:29:47.185
Do you want to meet her?

355
00:29:47.816 --> 00:29:48.856
Yes.

356
00:29:49.856 --> 00:29:52.455
Every time I have a conversation with her,

357
00:29:52.455 --> 00:29:53.955
I start feeling frustrated and angry.

358
00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:56.026
Is it easy for you to talk to her?

359
00:29:56.796 --> 00:29:58.165
She's not my family.

360
00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:00.495
What?

361
00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:03.965
I can have a conversation with her because I'm not her family.

362
00:30:05.205 --> 00:30:06.935
It takes a long time to get over grudges...

363
00:30:06.935 --> 00:30:09.076
when it comes to family because they've been there for a long time.

364
00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:10.846
But that's not the case for me.

365
00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:13.376
I've only started to build my relationship with her.

366
00:30:14.816 --> 00:30:16.145
It's been fine until now.

367
00:30:17.915 --> 00:30:20.056
I wonder how long...

368
00:30:21.056 --> 00:30:22.616
that will last.

369
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.360
(Episode 36 will air shortly.)
