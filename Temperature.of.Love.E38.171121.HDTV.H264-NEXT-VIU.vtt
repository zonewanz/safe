00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:08.010
(Episode 38)

2
00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:14.076
I reviewed the contract for Chef On's fridge commercial.

3
00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.476
I also reviewed the other contracts.

4
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.105
Please put them on my desk.

5
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:21.075
Mr. Park.

6
00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.015
Mail that was sent to your home have been returned.

7
00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:25.346
I moved.

8
00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:28.485
- I'll give you my new address. - Okay.

9
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:40.265
(Commercial Contract)

10
00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.436
(Taeyang Electronics Commercial Contract)

11
00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:00.786
You're here.

12
00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:04.185
- Do you want something to drink? - No. Sit down.

13
00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:12.695
It's a contract for a fridge advertisement.

14
00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:15.036
The legal team reviewed it already. Take a look.

15
00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:17.036
If there are no problems, we'll proceed.

16
00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:18.366
Okay.

17
00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:24.206
Of all the requests you received, I suggest you do the special lecture.

18
00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:25.605
Special lecture?

19
00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:27.445
It's a talk show from JK,

20
00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.116
and it's geared toward teenagers.

21
00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:32.215
You can be a good example and a good influence.

22
00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:34.215
It'll be good not only for your public image,

23
00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:36.655
but also for Good Soup.

24
00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:39.385
I like that it's not a cooking show.

25
00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.226
You seem positive about it, so I'll go ahead with it.

26
00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:47.896
- Where are you going? - Home.

27
00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:50.566
Do you still eat alone these days?

28
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.566
Old habits die hard.

29
00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:54.605
Bye.

30
00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:14.655
Whether we talk about America or not...

31
00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.565
- I mean... - Wait a minute.

32
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.396
That's a good attitude.

33
00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:22.565
Because the expression...

34
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:27.035
"having a sense of honor or shame" doesn't apply to a country.

35
00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:30.845
Cunning, promise, betrayal. These expressions...

36
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.676
are used between people.

37
00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:36.016
To a leader who only thinks about power,

38
00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.815
the word "promise" does not exist.

39
00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:40.856
Agreement, treaty...

40
00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:47.225
- You're home. - Yes.

41
00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.025
Did you do everything today?

42
00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:53.965
Yes. I met Chef On,

43
00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:57.736
and by chance or by destiny I met his mom too.

44
00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.236
- How about Hyun Soo? - She's like her daughter.

45
00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:05.405
She cares more about his mom than she does for me.

46
00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:08.676
Of course. She has to.

47
00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:13.116
Do you think they'll get married?

48
00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.856
If you think about their age, they have to.

49
00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:19.185
But it seemed like he has a complicated family history.

50
00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:24.025
When I think of it like that, I just want them to date.

51
00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.405
How did you make this?

52
00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:32.766
I have good taste for things like this.

53
00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:35.106
Did your mother go home safely?

54
00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:37.206
Yes, I saw her leave in a taxi.

55
00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.715
You asked me that for the second time.

56
00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:44.215
I'm just happy you didn't leave with your mom...

57
00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:45.916
and that you are staying here with me.

58
00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.986
I don't think I should be saying this to an older person,

59
00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.326
but you seem to have an adorable personality.

60
00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:56.095
That's because you haven't seen all of my sides yet.

61
00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:58.965
You have great taste in clothes too.

62
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.995
Your accessories, clothes, and shoes are balanced perfectly.

63
00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:05.065
You talk so sweetly.

64
00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:06.706
I'm just sweet.

65
00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:11.706
It's nice to have a job that you do with your own name.

66
00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:13.475
You can do it too.

67
00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:14.946
What would I do?

68
00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:17.485
I can't work under someone.

69
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:20.355
Then you can start your business.

70
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:31.965
You haven't left yet.

71
00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:34.896
I thought you were busy, and that you'd have left.

72
00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:38.206
Jung Sun, what do you think about me opening a flower shop?

73
00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:40.975
Why so suddenly?

74
00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:43.675
It's not an abrupt decision.

75
00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:47.016
I've been thinking about...

76
00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:48.576
opening a shop.

77
00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:51.086
I can't live off your money forever.

78
00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:54.386
Hyun Soo thinks I'll do great too.

79
00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:00.326
Yes.

80
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:03.365
Not anyone can start a business. You can't do it.

81
00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:06.336
It might fail. Just stay still, and don't cause trouble.

82
00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:09.095
Stay still? Am I dead?

83
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:10.636
Should I stay still as if I'm dead?

84
00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:14.876
I think I'd better leave. I'll see you later.

85
00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.506
Even Hyun Soo believes in me.

86
00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:18.746
You are my son. Why don't you trust me?

87
00:05:19.876 --> 00:05:20.876
Let's talk later.

88
00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:22.816
Are you embarrassed to talk about this in front of her?

89
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:24.115
Goodbye.

90
00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:29.725
You should see her off.

91
00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:48.475
Are you angry?

92
00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:50.706
I'm a little upset.

93
00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:52.845
Why's my mom like that?

94
00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.576
She has to live too.

95
00:05:56.415 --> 00:05:58.086
Hasn't she been living so far?

96
00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:01.485
She's been living for other people, not herself.

97
00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:07.196
Don't you think you should support her if she wants to do something?

98
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:09.896
It's hard for me to do that.

99
00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:14.665
Your relationship is more like a dad and daughter than a mom and son.

100
00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:17.605
It looks like a father is trying to stop his daughter...

101
00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:19.206
from becoming independent because he's worried.

102
00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:22.306
"I'll do everything for you. You just stay home."

103
00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:26.006
Do you think my mom has never been in business?

104
00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:27.016
She has.

105
00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:31.586
She's easily deceived, and she lends money as well as she borrows it.

106
00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:32.915
She's going to fail.

107
00:06:33.056 --> 00:06:34.285
Not this time.

108
00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:36.425
There's going to be a reliable customer.

109
00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.925
A reliable customer?

110
00:06:39.326 --> 00:06:40.396
Good Soup.

111
00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:45.396
Did you forget that I covered the report on Good Soup?

112
00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:47.336
I know everything.

113
00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:52.636
Soo Jung takes care of the flowers on the tables.

114
00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:54.136
But she has too much to do.

115
00:06:56.806 --> 00:06:58.975
You should help your mom to stand up for herself.

116
00:07:01.915 --> 00:07:05.115
You'll feel better when she becomes happy.

117
00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:11.655
Isn't it cruel to say that she should stay still...

118
00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:13.126
when she's still young?

119
00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:36.246
Don't judge...

120
00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:39.886
the days to come by the days you have lived.

121
00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:43.985
- Come in. - All right.

122
00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:49.925
This is a present from your mom.

123
00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:51.496
It's pretty.

124
00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:55.566
You just brought me home, and now you're here again.

125
00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:57.506
I keep wanting to see you.

126
00:07:58.405 --> 00:07:59.566
Come in.

127
00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:03.475
Where's Kyung?

128
00:08:04.306 --> 00:08:06.105
I'll be at my room.

129
00:08:06.345 --> 00:08:07.775
He'll leave soon.

130
00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:11.985
Should I leave soon?

131
00:08:12.615 --> 00:08:14.086
There is a script reading next week.

132
00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:16.556
I need to edit the script by this week.

133
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:20.155
Yet you spent the whole evening with my mom?

134
00:08:20.925 --> 00:08:22.525
You could say that.

135
00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.706
It's a small step,

136
00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:33.276
but I took it nonetheless thanks to you.

137
00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:36.745
Thank you for coming.

138
00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:41.845
Do you know how I saved your name in my cellphone?

139
00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:43.916
How?

140
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:45.885
Lee Hyun Soo.

141
00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:47.686
It's still just Lee Hyun Soo?

142
00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:51.385
I'll protect you until the end of time,

143
00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:54.595
so you won't ever lose yourself.

144
00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:16.416
I didn't know saving my name like that had such a meaning.

145
00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:40.306
(Jung Sun)

146
00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:42.776
That's when I realized...

147
00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:46.375
that Jung Sun and I...

148
00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:50.245
had different ways of loving each other.

149
00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:01.656
At 2pm today,

150
00:10:01.656 --> 00:10:04.196
there's a script reading for "Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls".

151
00:10:04.296 --> 00:10:05.326
I know.

152
00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:08.696
At 5pm, there's a script reading for "High Society" by Ji Hong Ah.

153
00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:13.706
It's cold.

154
00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:15.375
Why did you come out when it's so cold?

155
00:10:16.546 --> 00:10:18.206
Hello, Chef On.

156
00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:27.355
You didn't need to come, but I'm happy that you did.

157
00:10:27.715 --> 00:10:29.385
I'm happy that you're happy.

158
00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:32.556
You must be really happy.

159
00:10:32.826 --> 00:10:36.125
It's a script reading of her work, not yours.

160
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:37.725
That's why I'm happy.

161
00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:49.375
This reminds of Yeosu.

162
00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:51.446
We went there together.

163
00:10:52.145 --> 00:10:53.375
Please turn the music on.

164
00:10:54.076 --> 00:10:55.115
All right.

165
00:10:57.816 --> 00:10:58.816
Please turn it off.

166
00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:00.786
All right.

167
00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:03.456
Hyun Soo!

168
00:11:03.456 --> 00:11:06.456
Why not? I wanted to show off with my boyfriend too.

169
00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:07.796
I was jealous then.

170
00:11:09.296 --> 00:11:11.826
It's your day, so I'll allow it today.

171
00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:38.086
- Hello. - Hello.

172
00:11:40.796 --> 00:11:43.326
Jung Woo, can't you really allow the cameras?

173
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.066
Go.

174
00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:53.005
It's Director Kim. He must be here.

175
00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:55.005
Where are you?

176
00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:57.005
In the coffee shop?

177
00:12:00.475 --> 00:12:01.546
Where will it be held?

178
00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:03.145
It's probably going to be on the second floor. Let's go.

179
00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:21.735
Hello.

180
00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:24.406
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Park.

181
00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:26.706
Hello.

182
00:12:26.706 --> 00:12:28.706
- Here, Mr. Park. - Thanks.

183
00:12:31.076 --> 00:12:32.276
You should head upstairs first.

184
00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:33.615
Aren't you going upstairs?

185
00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:35.416
I just came by for a short while.

186
00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:38.485
Ji Hong Ah's script reading is today too. I need to go there.

187
00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:40.485
I've met everyone I needed to meet.

188
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.755
Hong Ah's script reading is held today?

189
00:12:43.385 --> 00:12:46.125
Your schedules keep clashing. It's making things tough for me.

190
00:12:49.026 --> 00:12:50.026
I'll go now.

191
00:13:04.406 --> 00:13:06.475
- Did you sleep well? - Yes, I did.

192
00:13:06.676 --> 00:13:08.145
- How's your condition? - It's great.

193
00:13:08.145 --> 00:13:10.286
- That's good to hear. - You're so pretty.

194
00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:11.515
My gosh.

195
00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:13.316
- You're here. - Hey, Hyun Soo.

196
00:13:14.515 --> 00:13:17.026
- Hello, Ms. Lee. - Hello.

197
00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:18.086
Ms. Lee.

198
00:13:19.056 --> 00:13:20.556
I enjoyed your last drama.

199
00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:22.095
- That medical drama. - Yes.

200
00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:24.495
Have you seen Jung Woo?

201
00:13:24.865 --> 00:13:26.735
He went to attend Hong Ah's script reading.

202
00:13:26.735 --> 00:13:28.365
That makes no sense.

203
00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:30.206
Why is he already leaving for a meeting that starts at 5pm?

204
00:13:38.076 --> 00:13:39.975
(Joon Ha)

205
00:13:41.515 --> 00:13:42.515
What?

206
00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:44.645
Why didn't you come inside?

207
00:13:45.946 --> 00:13:49.056
I reserved a restaurant for you. You can go there and eat afterwards.

208
00:13:49.355 --> 00:13:52.656
Gosh, the CEO should be here to give us a speech of encouragement.

209
00:13:52.926 --> 00:13:56.026
I sent another employee on behalf of me. Let's talk later.

210
00:13:57.526 --> 00:13:59.426
Jung Woo. Hello? Hello?

211
00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:01.566
What was that?

212
00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:03.036
Goodness.

213
00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:08.536
- I should go now. - You can come inside.

214
00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:10.676
No, it's okay. My duty is done here.

215
00:14:11.245 --> 00:14:13.515
I'll be back after I fulfill my duty.

216
00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.255
- You should go back inside. - Okay.

217
00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:25.026
You should go first. I'll see you leave.

218
00:14:25.255 --> 00:14:28.796
Okay. I should hurry up and leave so that you can go back inside.

219
00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:30.566
Bye.

220
00:14:35.066 --> 00:14:36.265
Love...

221
00:14:37.336 --> 00:14:39.735
is not when two good people meet.

222
00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.105
It's when two people who are in love come together.

223
00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:47.645
Hello.

224
00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:50.686
(Choi Won Joon)

225
00:14:54.656 --> 00:14:56.956
You're awfully pretty today, Writer Ji.

226
00:14:57.526 --> 00:15:00.556
My gosh. If you go a little further, it'll be sexual harassment.

227
00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:04.196
My goodness. It's time we become close.

228
00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:07.495
Hey, Mr. Park.

229
00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:09.806
- Mr. Park. - Hello.

230
00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:12.806
- Congratulations, Writer Ji. - Thank you.

231
00:15:13.036 --> 00:15:15.375
- What are you doing outside? - She insisted on...

232
00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:17.806
going inside with you. That's why we waited.

233
00:15:18.505 --> 00:15:20.845
I'm the only one who cares for you, aren't I?

234
00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:23.086
Let's just say that you are for today.

235
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:24.786
- Let's go. - Okay.

236
00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:36.465
You're here.

237
00:15:37.026 --> 00:15:38.526
Hyun Soo must've been happy.

238
00:15:39.066 --> 00:15:41.135
Were you at the script reading? Did you see the actors?

239
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.105
Ask me one at a time.

240
00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:45.465
Hong Ah's also doing a script reading today. Didn't she call you?

241
00:15:46.105 --> 00:15:48.076
It's going to be hard for her to contact me.

242
00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:50.345
Did you treat her harshly?

243
00:15:50.776 --> 00:15:52.845
Yes, I was harsh.

244
00:15:53.145 --> 00:15:54.515
I didn't want to see her again.

245
00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:56.586
You have no control over that.

246
00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:58.345
Exactly.

247
00:15:59.615 --> 00:16:01.186
I guess I can't hide it.

248
00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:03.456
Love is too cruel.

249
00:16:04.456 --> 00:16:07.225
I keep acting like Hong Ah since things aren't going my way.

253
00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:40.995
I'm seeing you often these days.

254
00:16:41.995 --> 00:16:44.125
I want to drink the coffee that you make.

255
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.465
You're making me work. What a bother.

256
00:16:57.605 --> 00:17:00.176
I'll sign the commercial contract. Set up a schedule for me.

257
00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:01.875
Okay.

258
00:17:03.015 --> 00:17:04.845
Did you take a look at the lecture proposal?

259
00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:07.056
Yes, I did. I'll do that too.

260
00:17:08.855 --> 00:17:10.586
It's weird to see you be so obedient.

261
00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:13.395
Wasn't I always obedient to you?

262
00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:15.326
Think again carefully.

263
00:17:17.925 --> 00:17:19.026
Never mind.

264
00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:28.536
I won't be able to sleep if I drink coffee right now.

265
00:17:29.306 --> 00:17:30.605
Then why are you drinking it?

266
00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:34.516
I wanted to try doing something you enjoy together.

267
00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:41.586
Hey, stop that.

268
00:17:42.256 --> 00:17:43.556
It's way too corny.

269
00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:49.326
Here.

270
00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:52.966
What's this?

271
00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:55.736
You can come anytime. It's hard to get a reservation these days.

272
00:18:00.105 --> 00:18:01.405
The thought of you making this...

273
00:18:02.536 --> 00:18:04.076
is already making me feel embarrassed.

274
00:18:04.546 --> 00:18:06.945
I felt really embarrassed while making it as well.

275
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.185
- Right? - Yes.

276
00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:15.885
- Good work. - Good work.

277
00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:18.655
- Good work. - We can do it!

278

Gosh, it's cold.

282
00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:27.266
Why did Mr. Park leave so early?

283
00:18:27.266 --> 00:18:29.566
I don't know. How am I supposed to know?

284
00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:32.336
But I can still guess.

285
00:18:32.836 --> 00:18:34.135
What?

286
00:18:34.135 --> 00:18:36.746
Why did you bring your boyfriend along on a day like this?

287
00:18:36.746 --> 00:18:38.605
I brought him along because it's a day like today.

288
00:18:39.246 --> 00:18:42.746
My gosh, I miss him even more now.

289
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:45.486
- Gosh, that's enough. - Hyun Soo.

290
00:18:46.086 --> 00:18:49.316
I did a lot of bad stuff to him.

291
00:18:50.286 --> 00:18:51.455
That's why.

292
00:18:51.955 --> 00:18:53.996
You repent on your past behaviors way too much...

293
00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:56.796
when you're in love.

294
00:18:57.165 --> 00:18:59.935
- What is it this time? - What is it this time?

295
00:19:29.695 --> 00:19:30.826
I'm scared.

296
00:19:35.736 --> 00:19:37.365
You pushed me away once.

297
00:19:38.165 --> 00:19:40.006
You can always do it again.

298
00:19:42.736 --> 00:19:44.645
He was right about that...

299
00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:46.375
in the end.

303
00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:00.395
Of course.

304
00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:02.556
Did you call to ask what I'm doing?

305
00:20:02.966 --> 00:20:05.566
No. I called to ask if we can meet tomorrow.

306
00:20:06.296 --> 00:20:08.935
Would that be okay for you? Aren't you really busy?

307
00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:11.365
I'm still going to see you even if I'm busy.

308
00:20:13.236 --> 00:20:14.435
I have something to say to you.

309
00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:27.455
There's something I need to report to you regarding Chef On.

It was written by a power-blogger.

323
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:16.836
Did she post it already?

324
00:21:16.836 --> 00:21:20.506
No, not yet. It's going to get published on a daily newspaper.

325
00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:23.046
How bad could this article effect Good Soup?

326
00:21:24.046 --> 00:21:28.145
It could be as bad as the allergy incident that happened in the past.

327

Show this to the Legal Team,

00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:47.466
I wonder if this looks okay.

330
00:21:58.345 --> 00:22:00.016
It's a small step.

331
00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:02.776
But I was able to take a step forward thanks to you.

332
00:22:07.586 --> 00:22:09.056
I'll protect you until the end of time,

333
00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:12.385
so you won't ever lose yourself.

334
00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:15.925
My gosh.

335
00:22:22.836 --> 00:22:23.905
What did the Legal Team say?

336
00:22:24.236 --> 00:22:25.766
They said we should come to a settlement with her.

337
00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:29.105
- Did you schedule a meeting? - No, she's being very persistent.

338
00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:31.076
Let's go to Good Soup first.

339
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.816
- Did you eat? - Yes, of course.

340
00:22:42.816 --> 00:22:44.986
- Would you like some tea? - Sure.

341
00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:55.435
What will you do with your mom?

342
00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.006
I'll have to see her and talk to her.

343
00:22:58.006 --> 00:23:00.736
Talking about family with you makes me feel like we're a family.

344
00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:02.806
Does that mean you're comfortable with me?

345
00:23:02.945 --> 00:23:04.945
What did you want to tell me? Why are you stalling?

346
00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:22.556
You really are showing up any time since you have a free pass.

347
00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:25.026
It's break time, so you can't have a meal.

348
00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:27.036
Do you think I'm here to eat?

349
00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:30.306
Shouldn't you be working instead of hanging out here?

350
00:23:31.466 --> 00:23:33.135
I need to take breaks, you know.

351
00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:35.935
She isn't your employee. Why are you grilling her?

352
00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:38.806
Stay out of this. It's none of your business.

353
00:23:39.345 --> 00:23:40.776
You have to nail at least one.

354
00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:42.915
Either the TV ratings or artistic quality.

355
00:23:43.246 --> 00:23:45.316
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

356
00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:46.685
Good answer.

357
00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:50.125
I better go now.

358
00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:52.026
Why did you come if you were going to leave?

359
00:23:56.966 --> 00:23:58.726
The man I like the most.

360
00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:00.895
Here's the woman I like the most.

361
00:24:01.635 --> 00:24:04.905
It's great to be with two people I like the most.

362
00:24:06.105 --> 00:24:08.836
I dropped by because I was in the area.

363
00:24:14.476 --> 00:24:15.615
As you were.

364
00:24:23.726 --> 00:24:25.125
Are you really going to leave like this?

365
00:24:45.806 --> 00:24:47.576
The break time is almost over,

366
00:24:47.816 --> 00:24:49.476
so we better talk here.

367
00:24:49.915 --> 00:24:51.345
I'm scared of what you're about to say.

368
00:24:54.185 --> 00:24:55.655
Don't be scared.

369
00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:59.385
It's time for Lee Hyun Soo's self-reflection.

370
00:24:59.925 --> 00:25:01.095
That sounds grand.

371
00:25:02.695 --> 00:25:04.726
In order for us to move forward,

372
00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:07.966
we need to clean up the past.

373
00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:10.905
We have to clean up, so we can move forward.

374
00:25:17.546 --> 00:25:18.746
I thought that...

375
00:25:20.046 --> 00:25:21.945
because I was older than you,

376
00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:26.086
I had more experience due to my age.

377
00:25:28.516 --> 00:25:30.155
I grew up being loved by my parents,

378
00:25:30.256 --> 00:25:32.286
so I thought I knew how to love.

379
00:25:33.195 --> 00:25:34.895
You know how to love.

380
00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:37.425
But that wasn't the case.

381
00:25:38.526 --> 00:25:41.466
Do you know what you are saved as on my phone?

382
00:25:44.105 --> 00:25:45.566
Jung Sun heart.

383
00:25:46.836 --> 00:25:47.875
What about it?

384
00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:50.306
You saved me as Lee Hyun Soo.

385
00:25:51.806 --> 00:25:55.276
When you loved me,

386
00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:59.216
you tried to keep me as I am.

387
00:26:01.086 --> 00:26:02.185
But...

388
00:26:03.226 --> 00:26:06.226
I think I was in love with the feeling of love.

389
00:26:10.296 --> 00:26:13.766
I thought the moth drawn to a flame was love.

390
00:26:16.336 --> 00:26:18.336
I thought it was okay to die.

391
00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:21.435
I liked that.

392
00:26:24.006 --> 00:26:25.845
In order to keep On Jung Sun...

393
00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:28.345
as On Jung Sun,

394
00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:31.345
I had to protect you,

395
00:26:33.756 --> 00:26:34.786
watch you,

396
00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:39.796
and wait for you.

397
00:26:50.635 --> 00:26:51.705
Take this,

398
00:26:52.405 --> 00:26:54.405
and give me the ring that you gave me before.

399
00:26:59.506 --> 00:27:01.246
You know what a ring means, right?
