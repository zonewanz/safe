1
00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:15.223
Goodnight.

2
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.363
Yes.

3
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:19.733
Goodnight.

4
00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:53.934
Do you want to...

5
00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:56.633
sleep with me...

6
00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:00.434
tonight?

7
00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:07.374
Yes.

8
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:18.854
What did you say?

9
00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.294
Let's break up.

10
00:01:22.863 --> 00:01:23.994
We should break up.

11
00:01:29.063 --> 00:01:30.104
Why?

12
00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:35.843
I said, why?

13
00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:38.414
I don't have the confidence.

14
00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:44.613
I'm not confident I can make you happy.

15
00:01:48.423 --> 00:01:50.054
What kind of nonsense is that?

16
00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:53.223
Is this a line of a play?

17
00:01:53.854 --> 00:01:55.693
Don't put up an act.

18
00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:03.563
It's not nonsense, and it's not an act.

19
00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.143
I mean it.

20
00:02:10.603 --> 00:02:12.374
I really want to stop.

21
00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:17.954
So you should seriously think about it and let me know.

22
00:02:19.184 --> 00:02:21.084
I'll stay at Sang Goo's for a while.

23
00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:24.924
Hey!

24
00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:28.424
How can you say that right now?

25
00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:31.934
You're not confident enough?

26
00:02:33.263 --> 00:02:36.133
You told me to wait 5 years more even after dating for 7 years!

27
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:38.073
And...

28
00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:41.603
And now you're telling me you're not confident?

29
00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:43.573
So don't wait for me!

30
00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:45.973
You're not the only one who dated for seven years.

31
00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:49.684
I did too. I was in the relationship for seven years too!

32
00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:51.883
But...

33
00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:54.554
why do you always talk as if you're the victim?

34
00:02:56.954 --> 00:02:59.894
Why do you talk as if you're the only one who had to wait?

35
00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:04.434
Because of that stupid marriage,

36
00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.964
I had to give up what I wanted. I gave up on my dream.

37
00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.633
Every day is suffocating for me!

38
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.843
Shirts and ties...

39
00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:23.813
are really uncomfortable. Did you know that?

40
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.744
You were waiting out here?

41
00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.253
It's cold. Why are you waiting here?

42
00:03:58.253 --> 00:03:59.913
I just went to the convenience store.

43
00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:01.283
I needed to pick up something.

44
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:02.753
It's cold, Mom. Let's go in.

45
00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:07.793
Did you even eat?

46
00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:10.424
I didn't eat so I could eat with you.

47
00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:48.833
You didn't have to.

48
00:04:51.703 --> 00:04:53.374
Okay. Thank you.

49
00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:19.864
This is my first time in your room after our wedding.

50
00:05:20.794 --> 00:05:21.963
You're right.

51
00:05:22.963 --> 00:05:26.874
I should have cleaned if I knew this would happen.

52
00:05:27.604 --> 00:05:29.374
No, it's nice.

53
00:05:30.573 --> 00:05:31.974
It's very you.

54
00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:34.614
It smells like you.

55
00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:37.213
Do I...

56
00:05:38.953 --> 00:05:41.554
smell?

57
00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:43.924
Sorry?

58
00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:45.724
But...

59
00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:47.823
No...

60
00:06:01.804 --> 00:06:03.773
"To Room 19"?

61
00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:05.374
Oh, that?

62
00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:09.114
It's a book I liked when I was in university.

63
00:06:10.013 --> 00:06:13.013
I've been reading it again.

64
00:06:14.753 --> 00:06:16.753
Could I ask you what it's about?

65
00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:21.864
There is a married couple.

66
00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:24.934
They're perfect,

67
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:29.333
even in the eyes of others.

68
00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:32.903
They're satisfied with their lives too.

69
00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.974
A happy and harmonious family.

70
00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:38.213
But...

71
00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:43.044
the wife suddenly wants to have a space of her own one day.

72
00:06:45.513 --> 00:06:49.854
So the husband makes a room for her on the second floor.

73
00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:52.594
Then they called it...

74
00:06:53.753 --> 00:06:55.364
"The Mother's Room".

75
00:06:57.934 --> 00:07:00.263
But soon enough,

76
00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:04.333
the kids start to enter that room.

77
00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:06.503
With the family going in and out,

78
00:07:09.044 --> 00:07:12.813
the room just becomes another family room.

79
00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:17.883
So what does the wife do?

80
00:07:19.354 --> 00:07:20.924
So the wife...

81
00:07:22.054 --> 00:07:24.724
gets a room without telling anyone...

82
00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:28.664
in a cheap hotel far away from home.

83
00:07:29.693 --> 00:07:32.763
Time to time, she stays alone in the room...

84
00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:36.034
a few hours at a time.

85
00:07:38.034 --> 00:07:40.203
She doesn't do anything.

86
00:07:41.974 --> 00:07:46.643
She feels happy just by being in the room.

87
00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:51.114
Because...

88
00:07:52.313 --> 00:07:56.023
the room is a space she can be perfectly alone.

89
00:07:58.424 --> 00:07:59.994
Getting married...

90
00:08:01.094 --> 00:08:04.833
also means that your own time and space disappears.

91
00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:08.563
Being without anyone else...

92
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:12.234
can make you feel happy. I can understand.

93
00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:15.443
It's a good story.

94
00:08:18.143 --> 00:08:22.244
I think it's also a sad story.

95
00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:27.753
Actually, I thought of you...

96
00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:29.953
while reading that book.

97
00:08:33.153 --> 00:08:34.464
You said...

98
00:08:35.763 --> 00:08:38.163
the only things you can be responsible for in life...

99
00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:41.234
are this house, Kitty,

100
00:08:42.303 --> 00:08:43.933
and yourself.

101
00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:48.704
That's why you won't get married.

102
00:08:51.143 --> 00:08:53.543
At the time, your words spoke to me.

103
00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:58.683
I too could only be responsible for this room.

104
00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:01.883
But...

105
00:09:03.883 --> 00:09:05.324
if you live like that,

106
00:09:09.864 --> 00:09:11.594
won't you get lonely?

107
00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:19.874
Have you ever thought that you might be lonely?

108
00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:24.673
I'm not sure.

109
00:09:26.374 --> 00:09:28.283
I don't think I ever...

110
00:09:29.484 --> 00:09:31.183
thought about being lonely.

111
00:09:33.053 --> 00:09:35.423
More than tolerating others,

112
00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:38.023
I thought it would be better to be alone.

113
00:09:39.594 --> 00:09:41.763
That's how I lived until now.

114
00:09:44.124 --> 00:09:45.633
I wanted to ask him.

115
00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:49.234
Being in love once in your life...

116
00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:52.533
is enough.

117
00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:57.303
If that one love has already passed in his life.

118
00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:01.383
And if it did,

119
00:10:02.383 --> 00:10:06.614
will love ever start again...

120
00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:08.683
for him?

121
00:10:14.594 --> 00:10:15.694
Shall we...

122
00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:20.334
go to bed now? It's late.

123
00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:23.403
Yes.

124
00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:29.643
I better bring my pillow.

125
00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:32.543
Okay.

126
00:11:21.964 --> 00:11:24.933
Yes. I think so too.

127
00:11:27.734 --> 00:11:29.604
Maybe I should have drank.

128
00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:34.503
No, I'm not a kid.

129
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.043
Right?

130
00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:42.314
I'll be an adult. I'll be mature.

131
00:12:32.594 --> 00:12:33.734
Ji Ho.

132
00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:37.433
- Are you sleeping? - Yes.

133
00:12:40.003 --> 00:12:41.104
I see.

134
00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:04.163
Ji Ho.

135
00:13:06.464 --> 00:13:07.604
Can I...

136
00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:11.074
hug you?

137
00:13:13.903 --> 00:13:15.043
Yes.

138
00:13:27.783 --> 00:13:29.454
It smells like you.

139
00:13:31.494 --> 00:13:34.523
Do I smell?

140
00:13:36.964 --> 00:13:39.564
It's your scent more specifically.

141
00:13:40.263 --> 00:13:42.503
I smell your scent.

142
00:13:44.403 --> 00:13:47.234
I see, you meant my scent.

143
00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.143
I'm glad you quit being a scriptwriter.

144
00:13:52.673 --> 00:13:53.773
What?

145
00:13:59.314 --> 00:14:01.523
Maybe it's not love yet.

146
00:14:03.423 --> 00:14:05.724
I was joking.

147
00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:10.824
It's all right even if it's not love.

148
00:14:13.194 --> 00:14:15.464
I'm not good at making jokes.

149
00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:19.273
Are you mad by any chance?

150
00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:23.874
Can I kiss you?

151
00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:29.244
Today's the first day that he visited my room.

152
00:14:32.653 --> 00:14:33.783
Yes.

153
00:14:50.803 --> 00:14:54.074
That's enough.

154
00:14:57.543 --> 00:15:01.244
(Episode 13: Because This Is My First Time Visiting Your Room)

155
00:15:29.944 --> 00:15:32.844
(She snores.)

156
00:15:35.344 --> 00:15:36.744
(How to make omelet rice)

157
00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:36.403
Give me that.

158
00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:41.913
You should stay for a few more days.

159
00:16:41.913 --> 00:16:44.283
Forget it. You're not the only one who works.

160
00:16:44.513 --> 00:16:45.814
I work too.

161
00:16:47.624 --> 00:16:50.023
Can't you quit working now?

162
00:16:50.683 --> 00:16:52.824
What nonsense are you talking about?

163
00:16:53.494 --> 00:16:55.694
You know I bought an apartment in Mullae-dong, right?

164
00:16:55.923 --> 00:16:57.423
We can move in there next year.

165
00:16:57.964 --> 00:17:00.464
So come to Seoul next year and live with me.

166
00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:05.203
If you really want to live with me, move to Namhae.

167
00:17:05.604 --> 00:17:07.534
I'm not kidding.

168
00:17:08.004 --> 00:17:11.114
Until when will you come and go from Seoul to Namhae?

169
00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.374
It's not like I travel by foot.

170
00:17:12.374 --> 00:17:15.743
I travel by bus, so it's not hard.

171
00:17:27.094 --> 00:17:28.223
Go now.

172
00:17:28.764 --> 00:17:30.824
What are you talking about? Get in.

173
00:17:30.993 --> 00:17:33.393
No, thanks. I'll take a subway.

174
00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:35.104
It goes straight to the bus terminal.

175
00:17:35.104 --> 00:17:38.374
Subway, my foot. Don't be stubborn and get in already.

176
00:17:38.374 --> 00:17:40.703
I heard you getting scolded by your superior just a while ago.

177
00:17:40.703 --> 00:17:42.973
Just go to work.

178
00:17:43.243 --> 00:17:44.314
Mom.

179
00:17:44.574 --> 00:17:46.314
I'll give you a ride.

180
00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.653
Hello, ma'am.

181
00:17:54.683 --> 00:17:56.923
I'm Soo Ji's boyfriend, Ma Sang Goo.

182
00:17:56.983 --> 00:17:59.493
- Her boyfriend? - Yes.

183
00:18:00.493 --> 00:18:02.723
I didn't know she had a boyfriend.

184
00:18:02.723 --> 00:18:05.133
She's not very talkative.

185
00:18:05.393 --> 00:18:08.663
I thought I should come say hello to you first, and that's why I'm here.

186
00:18:08.703 --> 00:18:11.074
You're so tall.

187
00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.973
Soo Ji is tall too.

188
00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:15.044
What a perfect match.

189
00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:18.243
I've never been a picky eater and liked eating spinach.

190
00:18:19.844 --> 00:18:20.943
Sorry, that was not funny.

191
00:18:21.213 --> 00:18:23.544
Soo Ji seems to be running late for work.

192
00:18:23.844 --> 00:18:26.314
I'll take you to the terminal today.

193
00:18:26.413 --> 00:18:28.423
- Please get in. - No.

194
00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:30.254
I'll take her to the terminal.

195
00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:33.124
Where is it? Is it that car over there?

196
00:18:33.124 --> 00:18:34.294
Yes.

197
00:18:34.594 --> 00:18:36.094
Please give it to me. I'll carry it for you.

198
00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:38.864
- Mom... - Hurry work. Bye.

199
00:18:47.604 --> 00:18:50.504
Soo Ji takes after you a lot.

200
00:18:50.574 --> 00:18:53.473
No way. She doesn't look like me at all.

201
00:18:53.874 --> 00:18:57.784
She's cute and bright, and I'm just pretty.

202
00:18:59.314 --> 00:19:01.754
Soo Ji isn't as pretty as when I was young.

203
00:19:01.754 --> 00:19:05.254
I think you're more beautiful than her even now.

204
00:19:07.693 --> 00:19:09.864
What do you do for work?

205
00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:13.393
I'm the CEO of the company that develops...

206
00:19:13.393 --> 00:19:14.903
social networking service.

207
00:19:15.163 --> 00:19:18.304
Our main service is called Dating, Not Marriage.

208
00:19:18.304 --> 00:19:19.604
It's a dating application.

209
00:19:20.274 --> 00:19:22.643
How should I explain?

210
00:19:23.374 --> 00:19:25.374
You know Ji Ho's husband, right?

211
00:19:25.374 --> 00:19:26.413
I'm the CEO of the company he works at.

212
00:19:26.413 --> 00:19:28.383
- Oh, Ji Ho's husband. - Yes.

213
00:19:28.643 --> 00:19:30.114
You're the CEO of that company?

214
00:19:30.114 --> 00:19:33.784
Yes, I'm his best friend and the CEO of that company.

215
00:19:34.223 --> 00:19:37.483
Then were you born in 1980 too?

216
00:19:37.723 --> 00:19:40.653
Yes, I'm 38 this year.

217
00:19:42.794 --> 00:19:44.463
You're older than I expected.

218
00:19:48.064 --> 00:19:49.733
It's fine as long as you're younger than me.

219
00:19:52.874 --> 00:19:56.673
You're not younger than me, are you?

220
00:20:37.913 --> 00:20:39.084
Well...

221
00:20:41.084 --> 00:20:43.624
- Give me a second. - Okay.

222
00:20:56.403 --> 00:20:58.034
What a...

223
00:20:59.874 --> 00:21:01.844
wonderful night.

224
00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:12.784
I'm done sleeping tonight.

225
00:21:59.264 --> 00:22:00.903
Did I fall straight into sleep there?

226
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.034
Is this real?

227
00:22:09.143 --> 00:22:11.074
How could I miss...

228
00:22:11.844 --> 00:22:14.314
this golden chance?

229
00:22:28.393 --> 00:22:30.124
I'm going to work first.

230
00:22:30.524 --> 00:22:32.834
Have breakfast.

231
00:22:32.834 --> 00:22:34.094
Breakfast?

232
00:23:04.993 --> 00:23:08.334
Onion's not cooked.

233
00:23:11.804 --> 00:23:13.374
Does he like raw food?

234
00:23:33.254 --> 00:23:35.064

(Scriptwriter Hwang Se Hee)

239
00:24:16.463 --> 00:24:18.633
- Hi. - You are here.

240
00:24:23.943 --> 00:24:25.014
- Ji Ho. - Yes?

241
00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:26.074
Do you know this person?

242
00:24:28.943 --> 00:24:31.014
(Ko Jung Min)

243
00:24:31.314 --> 00:24:32.453
Who is this?

244
00:24:32.614 --> 00:24:33.953
I don't know.

245
00:24:34.284 --> 00:24:36.883
It was when you left here already.

246
00:24:37.153 --> 00:24:38.893
That person said you would know when you see that.

247
00:24:39.393 --> 00:24:40.963
Was it a man or a woman?

248
00:24:41.193 --> 00:24:42.294
It was a man.

249
00:24:42.393 --> 00:24:44.064
He said he would call you soon.

250
00:24:46.334 --> 00:24:47.633

T-bone steak?

253
00:24:58.374 --> 00:24:59.973
How would you like your steak?

254
00:25:00.413 --> 00:25:01.514
What would you like?

255
00:25:02.243 --> 00:25:03.713
Medium-rare, please.

256
00:25:03.784 --> 00:25:06.153
I see. I will tell the chef.

257
00:25:06.153 --> 00:25:08.084
Please let me know if you need anything.

258
00:25:11.953 --> 00:25:13.953
Please set up the table number 14.

259
00:25:13.953 --> 00:25:15.064
I see.

260
00:25:17.633 --> 00:25:19.463
I think the manager's having a cold.

261
00:25:20.294 --> 00:25:21.903
- Really? - Yes.

262
00:25:22.504 --> 00:25:25.604
Her nose is running, and her eyes are red.

263
00:25:38.784 --> 00:25:40.953
Where are you? I'm really upset at you.

264
00:25:40.953 --> 00:25:43.124
You'd better come home now, Shim Won Seok.

265
00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:44.854
Answer your phone now.

266
00:25:45.254 --> 00:25:46.554
What are you doing?

267
00:25:46.554 --> 00:25:49.094
Please answer your phone.

268
00:25:49.094 --> 00:25:52.433
Are you really trying to end us?

269
00:25:54.034 --> 00:25:55.403
He read it, but didn't respond.

270
00:25:57.574 --> 00:25:59.173
He clearly read it.

271
00:26:00.504 --> 00:26:02.143
But he's not saying anything back.

272
00:26:13.913 --> 00:26:16.024
(I want to get married.)

273
00:26:19.324 --> 00:26:21.693
- Thank you! - Thank you.

274
00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:27.733
I'll go to the bathroom.

275
00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:43.743
How's your weekend?

276
00:26:47.254 --> 00:26:49.453
You look very kind and lovely.

277
00:26:49.453 --> 00:26:51.223
So I would love to know who you are.

278
00:26:51.223 --> 00:26:52.754
Thank you so much.

279
00:26:52.854 --> 00:26:55.423
I think we can get along well.

280
00:26:56.024 --> 00:26:58.794
I see. You look like a nice person too.

(I want to get married.)

283
00:27:10.443 --> 00:27:13.913
(I want to find someone I can spend my life with.)

284
00:27:35.203 --> 00:27:38.004
I know what you are trying to do. So please talk to me.

285
00:27:38.403 --> 00:27:42.104
Although we are going to break up, we should at least see each other.

286
00:27:46.913 --> 00:27:49.883
Meet me where we usually meet after work.

287

00:28:22.514 --> 00:28:25.284
Nobody can do what they want to do from the beginning.

290
00:28:25.584 --> 00:28:29.054
You can finally do what you want when you are successful.

291
00:28:29.453 --> 00:28:31.893
Ji Ho, have you not liked me at all?

292
00:28:31.893 --> 00:28:34.264
Don't do this. Stop it!

293
00:28:34.564 --> 00:28:37.223
Wait!

294
00:28:37.223 --> 00:28:39.433
We care about each other a lot.

295
00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:42.064
We don't want to break this team. That's why we are trying so hard.

296
00:28:42.064 --> 00:28:43.364
Did you say you are trying?

297
00:28:43.534 --> 00:28:46.274
Are you telling me to move on...

298
00:28:46.274 --> 00:28:48.104
just because I look okay?

299
00:28:48.104 --> 00:28:50.774
Is that why you dragged me here? Do you really think you are trying?

300
00:28:50.774 --> 00:28:53.374
But I'm actually bleeding and suffering to death.

301

Ms. Yoon.

302
00:28:55.183 --> 00:28:58.054
Do you think this is like a college club activity?

303
00:28:58.054 --> 00:29:00.854
If you are going to whine about such a small thing,

304
00:29:00.854 --> 00:29:02.723
you can't work on TV dramas.

305
00:29:02.953 --> 00:29:04.124
That's why...

306
00:29:06.354 --> 00:29:07.794
I want to quit.

307
00:29:09.193 --> 00:29:10.463
I'm never going to write again.

(Ko Jung Min)

309
00:29:43.524 --> 00:29:44.633
Thank you.

310
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:55.243
Aricha is my favorite coffee.

311
00:29:57.274 --> 00:30:00.443
I thought the CEO was a man.

312
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:03.784
Are you disappointed because it was me?

313
00:30:04.143 --> 00:30:05.913
No, I'm not.

314
00:30:06.784 --> 00:30:08.983
Honestly, I was a bit surprised.

315
00:30:10.153 --> 00:30:11.324
I know.

316
00:30:11.653 --> 00:30:14.624
I didn't know it could be you, the woman with the pretty earrings.

317
00:30:16.223 --> 00:30:17.463
I guess it's fate.

318
00:30:20.064 --> 00:30:22.534
It was our director who dropped by here yesterday.

319
00:30:22.804 --> 00:30:25.173
He said he sent you several text messages,

320
00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:27.034
but apparently, you never replied.

321
00:30:27.804 --> 00:30:29.143
That's true.

322
00:30:30.044 --> 00:30:32.213
My work has been a bit busy.

323
00:30:33.213 --> 00:30:34.743
But how did you know I was here?

324
00:30:35.844 --> 00:30:38.014
He called you once,

325
00:30:38.314 --> 00:30:40.483
and the other employee here answered your phone.

326
00:30:40.713 --> 00:30:42.754
He said you are...

327
00:30:42.754 --> 00:30:44.183
working here.

328
00:30:55.163 --> 00:30:57.733
I would love to officially introduce myself again.

329
00:30:58.133 --> 00:31:00.304
I came here after reading your script.

330
00:31:00.804 --> 00:31:03.173
I'm a CEO of a production company, Ko Jung Min.

331
00:31:08.643 --> 00:31:12.054
I saw your script you were going to work with Director Park.

332
00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:13.983
It was the script about the student residence.

333
00:31:15.754 --> 00:31:18.953
I was really curious about you and wanted to meet you so bad.

334
00:31:21.124 --> 00:31:23.594
More specifically,

335
00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:26.693
I would love to work with you.

336
00:31:30.163 --> 00:31:33.233
I don't write dramas anymore.

337
00:31:34.473 --> 00:31:37.673
It's been a while since I quit my assistant writer job.

338
00:31:40.574 --> 00:31:41.844
I'm sorry.

339
00:31:47.983 --> 00:31:50.483
You said you quit assistant writer job.

340
00:31:50.584 --> 00:31:52.294
Does it mean you quit writing too?

341
00:31:56.564 --> 00:32:00.564
I came here because I want to work with the writer.

342
00:32:26.094 --> 00:32:27.254
Hi, Soo Ji.

343
00:32:28.264 --> 00:32:29.423
Put your seat belt on.

344
00:32:29.923 --> 00:32:31.034
Yes, ma'am!

345
00:32:36.733 --> 00:32:40.233
Do you not write anymore?

346
00:32:41.673 --> 00:32:42.943
I'm sorry.

347
00:32:44.274 --> 00:32:47.784
I don't write anymore either.

348
00:32:52.284 --> 00:32:54.784
May I ask why?

349
00:32:56.754 --> 00:32:58.124
I'm married now.

350
00:32:58.754 --> 00:33:00.993
I decided to quit after the marriage.

351
00:33:02.223 --> 00:33:06.133
I'm here as a part-timer because it's too boring...

352
00:33:06.834 --> 00:33:07.933
to stay at home.

353
00:33:12.004 --> 00:33:14.473
You're married.

354
00:33:15.074 --> 00:33:16.143
Yes.

355
00:33:17.814 --> 00:33:20.544
I'm sorry. You had to come this far.

356
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:25.254
I'll go now.

357
00:33:27.624 --> 00:33:28.953
Take your time to finish it up.

358
00:33:33.794 --> 00:33:36.193
One thing, Ms. Yoon.

359
00:33:40.133 --> 00:33:41.564
Why does it sound...

360
00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:44.574
like a sad excuse to me?

361
00:33:54.143 --> 00:33:56.183
Thanks for the coffee.

362
00:33:59.653 --> 00:34:00.784
By any chance,

363
00:34:02.824 --> 00:34:05.423
if you want to tell me the truth instead of giving me a sad excuse,

364
00:34:05.923 --> 00:34:07.524
call me anytime.

365
00:34:09.924 --> 00:34:11.593
Even if we don't work together,

366
00:34:12.294 --> 00:34:14.064
we can go out for a drink.

367
00:34:39.088 --> 00:34:44.088
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E13 Because This is My First Life

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

368
00:35:02.343 --> 00:35:04.654
Why are you so mad?

369
00:35:10.154 --> 00:35:11.294
What are you trying to do?

370
00:35:12.154 --> 00:35:13.294
What do you mean?

371
00:35:13.493 --> 00:35:16.223
I sent your mom home for you...

372
00:35:16.663 --> 00:35:18.533
because you're too busy.

373
00:35:19.533 --> 00:35:20.533
What's wrong with it?

374
00:35:20.533 --> 00:35:22.663
Is this your type of dating?

375
00:35:23.663 --> 00:35:26.774
Intruding my personal space?

376
00:35:27.604 --> 00:35:29.904
And making me feel miserable?

377
00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:31.874
Miserable?

378
00:35:39.384 --> 00:35:41.024
How can you call...

379
00:35:41.984 --> 00:35:45.154
something as normal as showing each other's family...

380
00:35:45.924 --> 00:35:48.694
and knowing each other well miserable?

381
00:35:49.363 --> 00:35:50.823
I feel miserable!

382
00:35:51.933 --> 00:35:53.033
You think this is normal?

383
00:35:53.663 --> 00:35:55.763
Do you know how horrible that is to me?

384
00:35:56.763 --> 00:35:59.874
"What do your parents do?" "How are your parents?"

385
00:36:00.274 --> 00:36:04.203
I hate typical questions like those the most.

386
00:36:04.814 --> 00:36:06.073
Then you would say this.

387
00:36:06.613 --> 00:36:09.944
"Why would you take it that way? I didn't know."

388
00:36:10.783 --> 00:36:13.913
There are hundreds and thousands of people who ask this question.

389
00:36:14.823 --> 00:36:16.584
Do you know how it feels to live in such world?

390
00:36:16.584 --> 00:36:18.294
That's why we should live it together.

391
00:36:19.154 --> 00:36:20.294
I'm saying...

392
00:36:20.723 --> 00:36:22.763
I'll be right next to you in that world!

393
00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:27.263
Next to me?

394
00:36:28.663 --> 00:36:29.803
How?

395
00:36:31.004 --> 00:36:32.374
Let's say we get married.

396
00:36:33.674 --> 00:36:35.573
Do you think you can live with my mom?

397
00:36:37.714 --> 00:36:38.913
Answer me.

398
00:36:40.473 --> 00:36:41.984
Can you live with her too?

399
00:36:43.683 --> 00:36:45.183
Yes, I can. Why not?

400
00:36:46.314 --> 00:36:47.384
Right.

401
00:36:49.384 --> 00:36:51.553
What will you tell your parents?

402
00:36:53.254 --> 00:36:55.024
"I'll get married to a girl..."

403
00:36:55.863 --> 00:36:59.334
"who doesn't know who her father is and whose mother is disabled."

404
00:37:00.294 --> 00:37:01.763
Will you introduce me to your parents like that?

405
00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:13.544
My mom...

406
00:37:15.113 --> 00:37:18.384
worked in a restaurant to raise me alone with her disabled body.

407
00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:22.823
Luckily, I studied well...

408
00:37:23.854 --> 00:37:26.654
and got into a good company that pays well.

409
00:37:28.223 --> 00:37:29.663
I finally got to...

410
00:37:31.134 --> 00:37:32.763
support her.

411
00:37:35.564 --> 00:37:37.163
I don't know about the world like yours in which...

412
00:37:37.604 --> 00:37:39.703
the family lives in a happily built house...

413
00:37:40.604 --> 00:37:42.703
and live normally.

414
00:37:45.544 --> 00:37:46.643
My mom...

415
00:37:49.013 --> 00:37:50.884
has only me...

416
00:37:52.584 --> 00:37:54.223
to rely on.

417
00:37:57.794 --> 00:38:00.024
I'm the only one to bury her.

418
00:38:07.033 --> 00:38:09.334
That's the world I have to live in.

419
00:38:13.803 --> 00:38:15.973
So don't give me false hopes.

420
00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:21.944
You being sweet...

421
00:38:26.183 --> 00:38:28.384
makes me want to be a part of your world.

422
00:38:58.754 --> 00:39:00.354
In the novel "To Room 19",

423
00:39:00.354 --> 00:39:03.154
the main character ends up...

424
00:39:05.354 --> 00:39:07.424
getting the hidden room...

425
00:39:07.624 --> 00:39:09.723
caught by her husband.

426
00:39:12.334 --> 00:39:15.964
And the girl lies to her husband...

427
00:39:17.734 --> 00:39:19.774
that she had been having an affair.

428
00:39:21.743 --> 00:39:23.904
I was 20 back then and...

429
00:39:24.444 --> 00:39:27.013
I couldn't understand her.

430
00:39:28.643 --> 00:39:31.453
Is the room's existence more important than...

431
00:39:32.354 --> 00:39:35.783
lying about the affair?

432
00:39:38.924 --> 00:39:40.223
I think I understand.

433
00:39:41.163 --> 00:39:43.363
That room means nothing...

434
00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:45.363
if people find out about it.

435
00:39:46.294 --> 00:39:49.634
But how could she lie that she had been having an affair?

436
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:56.573
"For the past year, I have spent my day time..."

437
00:39:56.573 --> 00:39:58.343
"in a dirty hotel room."

438
00:39:58.473 --> 00:40:00.044
"That place makes me happy."

439
00:40:00.214 --> 00:40:02.683
"In fact, I don't exist without it."

440
00:40:02.783 --> 00:40:05.953
"She realized that when she says such things, her husband..."

441
00:40:06.154 --> 00:40:07.384
"would be scared."

442
00:40:08.484 --> 00:40:10.384
- Can't you get it? - No.

443
00:40:12.254 --> 00:40:13.524
So this means...

444
00:40:13.924 --> 00:40:16.393
it's easier to be crazy than to explain...

445
00:40:16.593 --> 00:40:18.393
something that people can't understand.

446
00:40:19.263 --> 00:40:22.104
Actually, it's more convenient that way.

447
00:40:23.803 --> 00:40:26.073
It's better to be crazy than pathetic.

448
00:40:30.174 --> 00:40:32.444
Why did I answer...

449
00:40:33.714 --> 00:40:34.843
to that lady...

450
00:40:35.783 --> 00:40:37.714
like that?

451
00:40:38.683 --> 00:40:41.183
Why did I tell her that I got married...

452
00:40:42.254 --> 00:40:43.384
when she asked me...

453
00:40:43.823 --> 00:40:46.323
if I still write?

454
00:41:21.194 --> 00:41:23.163
Let's talk about it later if you're going to cry.

455
00:41:25.493 --> 00:41:26.734
I'm not crying.

456
00:41:27.734 --> 00:41:28.933
I'm not going to cry.

457
00:41:31.634 --> 00:41:33.203
Have you thought about it?

458
00:41:35.803 --> 00:41:36.973
Yes.

459
00:41:43.743 --> 00:41:46.953
I was wrong.

460
00:41:50.223 --> 00:41:51.754
What did you do wrong?

461
00:41:53.424 --> 00:41:55.524
Yelling. Getting mad at you.

462
00:41:56.924 --> 00:42:00.294
I only nagged you when you bought me a sofa.

463
00:42:01.134 --> 00:42:02.303
And...

464
00:42:04.703 --> 00:42:07.174
I kept asking you to marry me.

465
00:42:08.073 --> 00:42:11.013
- And... - What difference would it make?

466
00:42:13.113 --> 00:42:14.214
Sorry?

467
00:42:15.743 --> 00:42:18.984
Will you not ask me to marry you if we see each other again?

468
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.493
If you don't like it,

469
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:27.863
I won't.

470
00:42:27.924 --> 00:42:30.093
It's not a matter of that!

471
00:42:30.863 --> 00:42:32.533
You just want to get married.

472
00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:34.834
Why would you hide your desire just because of me?

473
00:42:35.404 --> 00:42:36.964
I'm not hiding it.

474
00:42:37.703 --> 00:42:40.874
- I want to marry you, so... - You want to get married to me?

475
00:42:41.073 --> 00:42:42.203
Are you sure?

476
00:42:42.604 --> 00:42:44.643
Can you confidently say that?

477
00:42:44.643 --> 00:42:46.573
What are you talking about?

478
00:42:47.913 --> 00:42:49.743
You were talking with some other man.

479
00:42:51.854 --> 00:42:53.013
I saw you...

480
00:42:55.283 --> 00:42:57.183
chatting with some other man on our dating app.

481
00:43:01.093 --> 00:43:03.823
I just tried it for fun.

482
00:43:03.823 --> 00:43:06.033
I just installed the app because you go to that company.

483
00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:08.634
- Someone said hi and... - But you talked with someone.

484
00:43:09.033 --> 00:43:11.303
I just did it for fun. It didn't mean anything.

485
00:43:11.303 --> 00:43:12.573
Of course it means something.

486
00:43:13.134 --> 00:43:14.904
You want to get married.

487
00:43:14.904 --> 00:43:17.143
You talked with some man who was looking for a girl to get married.

488
00:43:17.973 --> 00:43:19.674
And it still doesn't mean anything?

489
00:43:20.513 --> 00:43:23.413
No. It's not like that.

490
00:43:23.413 --> 00:43:24.513
Is it not?

491
00:43:25.683 --> 00:43:27.654
But that does mean something.

492
00:43:28.984 --> 00:43:30.854
How were we like in the past few months?

493
00:43:31.593 --> 00:43:33.093
You kept asking me to get married.

494
00:43:33.093 --> 00:43:34.924
I was always running away from it.

495
00:43:37.124 --> 00:43:39.064
You always pressured me.

496
00:43:40.734 --> 00:43:42.104
I couldn't satisfy you.

497
00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:45.004
That's the fact and how it is.

498
00:43:48.973 --> 00:43:53.274
How you answered the man is also a part of your heart.

499
00:43:55.513 --> 00:43:59.584
I hope you could be honest with what your heart says.

500
00:44:05.524 --> 00:44:07.024
Let's finish it here.

501
00:44:09.464 --> 00:44:10.663
I'm tired too.

502
00:44:12.533 --> 00:44:14.533
I'll get my things out when you aren't home.

503
00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:23.874
No, Won Seok.

504
00:44:24.913 --> 00:44:26.044
Don't go.

505
00:44:27.013 --> 00:44:28.643
Please don't go.

506
00:44:29.643 --> 00:44:31.754
How can I live without you?

507
00:44:32.314 --> 00:44:34.584
How can I live without you?

508
00:44:35.924 --> 00:44:38.053
How can I live alone?

509
00:44:40.393 --> 00:44:41.823
I can't...

510
00:44:42.564 --> 00:44:45.493
How can I go inside the house without you?

511
00:44:45.964 --> 00:44:47.564
Please don't go.

512
00:44:51.274 --> 00:44:53.374
I'll die if you're gone.

513
00:45:01.944 --> 00:45:03.513
You won't die even if I'm not there.

514
00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:05.714
You'll get over me soon.

515
00:45:06.613 --> 00:45:08.223
You'll be fine soon.

516
00:45:25.334 --> 00:45:28.444
How was your day?

517
00:45:29.573 --> 00:45:33.613
It was peaceful like the other days.

518
00:45:34.444 --> 00:45:35.714
What about yours?

519
00:45:35.814 --> 00:45:39.413
Nothing special happened to me too.

520
00:45:45.254 --> 00:45:49.424
Actually, something happened to me.

521
00:45:59.604 --> 00:46:01.604
Some production company's CEO...

522
00:46:02.973 --> 00:46:04.513
came to talk to me.

523
00:46:05.174 --> 00:46:06.544
A production company?

524
00:46:07.243 --> 00:46:08.714
Yes, some drama production company.

525
00:46:09.714 --> 00:46:12.413
She came to ask me to work with her.

526
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:15.654
You want to work again?

527
00:46:16.453 --> 00:46:19.194
No, it's not like that.

528
00:46:21.424 --> 00:46:25.263
I don't know what I want yet.

529
00:46:29.863 --> 00:46:31.433
Doesn't her name sound like a man's?

530
00:46:32.834 --> 00:46:35.143
Was it a woman?

531
00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:37.274
Yes.

532
00:46:38.243 --> 00:46:42.544
She was a strong woman.

533
00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:46.714
She was strong...

534
00:46:46.714 --> 00:46:49.754
in a way that she doesn't hurt others but...

535
00:46:50.484 --> 00:46:52.194
protects instead.

536
00:46:54.763 --> 00:46:57.464
She wasn't ordinary.

537
00:46:58.734 --> 00:47:01.033
But her name was.

538
00:47:04.604 --> 00:47:05.703
You're right.

539
00:47:06.904 --> 00:47:08.143
It's a common name.

540
00:47:11.243 --> 00:47:12.413
Yes.

541
00:47:14.314 --> 00:47:17.113
What? Really?

542
00:47:24.524 --> 00:47:25.624
Ho Rang.

543
00:47:27.294 --> 00:47:29.893
She was sitting like this in some park and I brought her here.

544
00:47:30.694 --> 00:47:32.834
She said she couldn't walk because her legs gave way.

545
00:47:33.863 --> 00:47:36.363
Ho Rang. Ho Rang.

546
00:47:38.004 --> 00:47:41.104
Let's get inside and lie down.

547
00:47:42.803 --> 00:47:45.444
Yes. Let's get in. You'll catch a cold.

548
00:47:47.613 --> 00:47:49.143
I can't...

549
00:47:51.013 --> 00:47:52.214
get inside that room.

550
00:47:53.553 --> 00:47:55.084
I just can't.

551
00:48:11.803 --> 00:48:13.573
You're really here?

552
00:48:15.504 --> 00:48:18.113
It's Se Hee! Nam Se Hee!

553
00:48:18.674 --> 00:48:22.343
See? I told you. Se Hee will be here when I call him.

554
00:48:22.843 --> 00:48:24.013
Did he drink a lot?

555
00:48:24.783 --> 00:48:25.884
Yes.

556
00:48:25.984 --> 00:48:28.754
Let's drink up, my mentor.

557
00:48:29.884 --> 00:48:31.854
- Mentor? - Sure!

558
00:48:31.993 --> 00:48:35.093
You're not my mentor anymore. Se Hee is.

559
00:48:35.694 --> 00:48:38.234
What did he say?

560
00:48:38.964 --> 00:48:40.433
What did you tell him?

561
00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:43.533
Se Hee said that I have to be honest.

562
00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:46.026
All those subjects in your sentences...

563
00:48:47.303 --> 00:48:49.843
are all you, Won Seok.

564
00:48:49.904 --> 00:48:53.073
You don't have anyone else as a subject in your sentences.

565
00:48:53.243 --> 00:48:55.984
So I changed the subject in my sentences.

566
00:48:56.343 --> 00:48:57.553
Ho Rang...

567
00:48:59.084 --> 00:49:01.953
smiles because of me.

568
00:49:02.424 --> 00:49:03.783
Perhaps she and I...

569
00:49:04.354 --> 00:49:07.323
are like the parallel lines that never meet.

570
00:49:07.694 --> 00:49:10.993
Ho Rang is happy...

571
00:49:12.393 --> 00:49:13.593
because of me.

572
00:49:13.694 --> 00:49:17.973
Won Seok, I'll be 35 after 5 years.

573
00:49:18.573 --> 00:49:21.274
Are you asking me to just date for 12 years?

574
00:49:21.604 --> 00:49:26.143
Ho Rang can't live without me.

575
00:49:26.143 --> 00:49:27.884
(How's your weekend going?)

576
00:49:27.884 --> 00:49:30.613
When I replaced the subjects,

577
00:49:30.984 --> 00:49:33.384
the answer was quite simple.

578
00:49:34.783 --> 00:49:36.854
The initial formula to get the answer...

579
00:49:37.524 --> 00:49:39.924
was wrong in the first place.

580
00:49:40.964 --> 00:49:42.763
For seven years,

581
00:49:43.723 --> 00:49:48.604
I had been choosing the paths that made only me happy.

582
00:50:13.553 --> 00:50:15.363
Life is too long.

583
00:50:16.393 --> 00:50:18.163
There are too many unwanted scenes.

584
00:50:19.393 --> 00:50:20.564
You're right.

585
00:50:21.933 --> 00:50:24.533
Things will get only worse.

586
00:50:27.573 --> 00:50:29.203
You look troubled too today.

587
00:50:30.504 --> 00:50:34.884
Some production company's CEO came to talk to me.

588
00:50:36.584 --> 00:50:38.154
She told me she wants me to work with her.

589
00:50:41.754 --> 00:50:44.823
But I...

590
00:50:46.754 --> 00:50:48.993
answered that I got married...

591
00:50:49.924 --> 00:50:52.893
to her question asking if I still write.

592
00:50:55.104 --> 00:50:56.433
Why did I do that?

593
00:51:00.734 --> 00:51:04.473
Maybe you were lazy to explain.

594
00:51:05.544 --> 00:51:07.343
Sometimes, marriage can be...

595
00:51:08.183 --> 00:51:10.714
a good shield in the society.

596
00:51:11.584 --> 00:51:13.714
A shield so strong that it can't be penetrated.

597
00:51:14.984 --> 00:51:16.154
But...

598
00:51:18.093 --> 00:51:20.723
I thought I was a coward at the moment.

599
00:51:20.854 --> 00:51:22.564
No, you're not.

600
00:51:23.763 --> 00:51:26.363
There are times when you just want to be like others.

601
00:51:28.004 --> 00:51:29.134
Life...

602
00:51:30.203 --> 00:51:32.973
needs a shoulder to depend on.

603
00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:36.174
Soo Ji, do you also...

604
00:51:37.743 --> 00:51:39.743
depend on someone?

605
00:51:41.183 --> 00:51:42.243
Who?

606
00:51:43.743 --> 00:51:44.984
Mr. Ma?

607
00:51:48.424 --> 00:51:50.223
I don't need to depend...

608
00:51:51.194 --> 00:51:53.024
on anyone.

609
00:51:54.053 --> 00:51:55.163
What?

610
00:51:55.493 --> 00:51:57.424
My mom's supporting me.

611
00:51:58.694 --> 00:52:00.794
I should give a call to my mom.

612
00:52:08.874 --> 00:52:11.413
Why would you say something like that to a kid?

613
00:52:14.584 --> 00:52:18.283
That's not actually what I told him.

614
00:52:20.854 --> 00:52:22.984
That's what you told me...

615
00:52:25.624 --> 00:52:26.924
12 years ago.

616
00:52:30.863 --> 00:52:31.964
Se Hee.

617
00:52:44.004 --> 00:52:47.884
Men are all selfish.

618
00:52:48.413 --> 00:52:50.783
It's a greed to...

619
00:52:51.154 --> 00:52:53.254
not let go of someone.

620
00:52:54.453 --> 00:52:56.354
You like it when you're with her.

621
00:52:56.683 --> 00:52:58.794
You want to make her happy.

622
00:52:59.493 --> 00:53:03.223
You feel like you can't live without her, right?

623
00:53:04.993 --> 00:53:06.464
But...

624
00:53:07.234 --> 00:53:09.763
Jung Min doesn't feel the same way.

625
00:53:10.464 --> 00:53:13.604
She's not happy with you anymore.

626
00:53:14.134 --> 00:53:17.174
Her life is bearable without you.

627
00:53:17.913 --> 00:53:19.314
That's why she left you.

628
00:53:24.214 --> 00:53:25.953
We talked about it here?

629
00:53:26.654 --> 00:53:28.223
Gosh, time flies.

630
00:53:33.053 --> 00:53:35.124
Hey, by any chance,

631
00:53:36.223 --> 00:53:38.493
did you two have something I didn't know then?

632
00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:42.203
I mean, both of you suddenly applied to take some time off from school.

633
00:53:42.564 --> 00:53:45.203
Jung Min didn't return to school and disappeared.

634
00:53:45.774 --> 00:53:48.203
It's strange now that I think about it.

635
00:53:49.973 --> 00:53:51.274
Have you...

636
00:53:52.674 --> 00:53:56.444
heard anything about her since then?

637
00:53:56.814 --> 00:53:58.084
No.

638
00:53:59.314 --> 00:54:02.424
She cut off ties with all her friends in school.

639
00:54:03.453 --> 00:54:06.194
I think I heard that she went to the US.

640
00:54:06.524 --> 00:54:08.024
You can't throw up there.

641
00:54:08.024 --> 00:54:10.663
Don't move. I'll take you to the toilet.

642
00:54:12.064 --> 00:54:13.234
Gosh.

643
00:54:13.863 --> 00:54:15.033
Hold it in.

644
00:54:25.814 --> 00:54:28.544
(Ko Jung Min)

645
00:54:35.624 --> 00:54:37.223
Shouldn't you eat something?

646
00:54:38.053 --> 00:54:39.194
I'm okay.

647
00:54:44.064 --> 00:54:45.593
I'll go inside first.

648
00:54:46.964 --> 00:54:49.303
Don't sleep on the floor. Sleep in my bed.

649
00:55:18.132 --> 00:55:19.261
How is Won Seok?

650
00:55:20.331 --> 00:55:22.531
I'm taking good care of him.

651
00:55:28.172 --> 00:55:29.172
Soo Ji.

652
00:55:31.312 --> 00:55:33.312
I followed you to your house in secret...

653
00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:35.741
on the day I saw a text from your mom.

654
00:55:37.112 --> 00:55:39.382
I was worried you might be seeing another guy.

655
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:42.681
So I ran up the stairs like crazy.

656
00:55:46.422 --> 00:55:47.661
I'm such a loser, aren't I?

657
00:55:50.761 --> 00:55:54.161
Like you said, maybe I don't know much about your life.

658
00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:58.971
I grew up in an ordinary family without much trouble.

659
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:04.042
So to be honest, I find you hard to deal with.

660
00:56:05.572 --> 00:56:09.511
Sometimes, your sharp words are too much for me to handle.

661
00:56:12.411 --> 00:56:13.681
But you know what?

662
00:56:16.482 --> 00:56:18.491
Maybe I like you very much.

663
00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:23.761
Your sharp words hurt me here and there,

664
00:56:25.092 --> 00:56:26.692
and it's so painful,

665
00:56:28.902 --> 00:56:32.072
but if you could feel much at ease by hurting me,

666
00:56:35.042 --> 00:56:36.502
I'd be glad.

667
00:56:38.342 --> 00:56:40.241
That's what I think.

668
00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:44.252
I won't intrude your privacy...

669
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:47.281
unexpectedly like today from now on.

670
00:56:49.221 --> 00:56:52.121
And I won't act like I know everything about your world.

671
00:56:56.062 --> 00:56:57.261
But...

672
00:57:01.101 --> 00:57:04.831
I hope you to face the world properly.

673
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:11.172
The way I see it, you've never faced the world properly.

674
00:57:12.871 --> 00:57:16.342
You've always run away or fought back.

675
00:57:17.882 --> 00:57:20.181
Using your company and mother as excuses,

676
00:57:23.051 --> 00:57:25.491
you've always blamed the world.

677
00:57:25.951 --> 00:57:28.692
I believe that you need to face the world...

678
00:57:29.462 --> 00:57:32.862
and say what you want to say at least for once in your life.

679
00:57:33.831 --> 00:57:35.331
And once you begin,

680
00:57:36.502 --> 00:57:39.402
I'm ready to support you by your side.

681
00:57:40.072 --> 00:57:41.172
Do you understand?

682
00:57:47.982 --> 00:57:50.312
That was so charismatic.

683
00:57:54.681 --> 00:57:58.092
I'm a bit scared to be scolded by you twice a day,

684
00:57:58.792 --> 00:58:01.221
so I'll stop here and fall back.

685
00:58:01.592 --> 00:58:03.592
I'll see you later, Soo Ji.

686
00:58:03.991 --> 00:58:05.192
Bye.

687
00:58:05.761 --> 00:58:08.801
Gosh, Soo Ji is the scariest in the world.

688
00:58:24.982 --> 00:58:27.851
He's so unpredictable.

689
00:58:38.192 --> 00:58:42.062
Everyone has Room 19 of their own.

690
00:58:45.572 --> 00:58:49.402
No matter how close they are with others, they don't want them...

691
00:58:49.942 --> 00:58:51.141
to find out about that room.

692
00:59:01.522 --> 00:59:02.652
By the way,

693
00:59:03.451 --> 00:59:06.822
why do you keep sitting on the floor?

694
00:59:07.051 --> 00:59:08.221
What?

695
00:59:11.761 --> 00:59:14.601
I'm used to sitting on the floor.

696
00:59:15.132 --> 00:59:16.502
I feel more comfortable this way.

697
00:59:16.862 --> 00:59:19.732
But why did you sit on the sofa before?

698
00:59:23.502 --> 00:59:25.212
Then I felt...

699
00:59:26.741 --> 00:59:29.281
a little uncomfortable in this house.

700
00:59:30.911 --> 00:59:32.112
You too.

701
00:59:32.212 --> 00:59:34.451
You felt uncomfortable around me?

702
00:59:41.422 --> 00:59:43.062
No matter how comfortable they feel around others,

703
00:59:44.391 --> 00:59:47.431
they can't invite those others to that room.

704
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:51.232
- Goodnight. - Thanks.

705
00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:52.801
You too.

706
00:59:56.471 --> 00:59:58.672
I forgot to give this back to you.

707
00:59:59.641 --> 01:00:01.081
Oh, right.

708
01:00:02.011 --> 01:00:03.542
Well, Ji Ho.

709
01:00:04.081 --> 01:00:05.181
Yes?

710
01:00:05.752 --> 01:00:07.451
About the offer...

711
01:00:08.252 --> 01:00:10.051
I don't know much about it,

712
01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:14.522
but you're not hesitating because of our marriage, are you?

713
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:17.991
- What? - By any chance,

714
01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:19.962
if this marriage...

715
01:00:21.261 --> 01:00:24.002
is in the way to your future...

716
01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:26.572
I hope you don't hesitate because of it.

717
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:29.801
Like I promised,

718
01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:32.411
I don't want to...

719
01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:35.442
cause any harm to you.

720
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:41.322
Okay.

721
01:00:42.422 --> 01:00:45.792
I understand what you mean.

722
01:00:47.962 --> 01:00:48.991
Okay.

723
01:01:01.942 --> 01:01:05.371
Maybe both he and I...

724
01:01:08.942 --> 01:01:11.181
(Ko Jung Min)

725
01:01:12.152 --> 01:01:16.351
need to take a rest in our own Room 19 today.

726
01:01:26.491 --> 01:01:29.862
(Scripts)

727
01:01:45.551 --> 01:01:48.422
Ho Rang, what do you want to have for breakfast?

728
01:02:13.572 --> 01:02:14.781
You were home.

729
01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:18.752
I'm just dropping by. I need to pack my things.

730
01:02:20.181 --> 01:02:21.851
Why are you packing?

731
01:02:21.851 --> 01:02:23.181
I just need to move out.

732
01:02:23.882 --> 01:02:25.451
I thought about that too.

733
01:02:26.322 --> 01:02:28.362
But I think I should move out.

734
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:30.721
You should stay here.

735
01:02:33.062 --> 01:02:36.761
Why are you moving out? You paid for the key money too.

736
01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:39.772
Let's talk about that later.

737
01:02:40.431 --> 01:02:43.701
You can give that back to me at the end of the contract.

738
01:02:58.322 --> 01:02:59.422
Ho Rang.

739
01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.132
Are you...

740
01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:09.402
okay?

741
01:03:13.402 --> 01:03:14.502
I'm fine.

742
01:03:15.971 --> 01:03:18.342
I feel a lot better.

743
01:03:20.612 --> 01:03:22.842
I'm glad to hear that.

744
01:03:26.312 --> 01:03:27.411
I'm leaving.

745
01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:43.601
You are right.

746
01:03:46.172 --> 01:03:47.301
I should be...

747
01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:50.301
honest to myself.

748
01:03:51.511 --> 01:03:52.971
I'm going to try that from now on.

749
01:04:45.962 --> 01:04:47.362
(MY Entertainment)

750
01:04:47.362 --> 01:04:51.272
It's time to be honest to myself.

751
01:04:52.132 --> 01:04:53.232
Please come this way.

752
01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:02.842
Yes?

753
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.020
I want to write.

754
01:05:19.719 --> 01:05:21.820
I want to write something good.

755
01:05:23.159 --> 01:05:25.829
I'm not sure...

756
01:05:26.759 --> 01:05:28.599
what you want yet.

757
01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:35.139
But I want to write a good story that I can talk about.

758
01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.009
That's what I want.

759
01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:42.440
You just need to write your own script with your own story.

760
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:51.290
But I need to sort out one thing before that.

761
01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:53.889
What is it?

762
01:05:57.389 --> 01:06:00.060
Are you already under a contract?

763
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.130
No, that's not it.

764
01:06:02.929 --> 01:06:05.670
There's a reason why I quit my job.

765
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.969
I was almost raped...

766
01:06:12.509 --> 01:06:14.540
by the assistant director I was working with.

767
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.080
That's what I want to deal with first.

768
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:29.259
I think I can write after that.

769
01:06:31.959 --> 01:06:33.589
If that's the case,

770
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:36.999
we should do that.

771
01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:40.330
How would you like to sort it out?

772
01:06:40.469 --> 01:06:42.900
I want to talk about it with you. That's why I'm here today.

773
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.469
I don't know any options.

774
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:51.209
There are possibly two ways to take care of this.

775
01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:53.910
It's a bit complicated, but we can just sue him.

776
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.620
Or...

777
01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.349
we can simply get rid of him.

778
01:07:00.419 --> 01:07:02.160
- Do we get rid of him? - Yes.

779
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.429
I prefer the latter option.

780
01:07:04.929 --> 01:07:06.889
My employees are good at that.

781
01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.429
What do they do?

782
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:15.999
We can just shock him to death,

783
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:18.770
or he will die because of his funny situation.

784
01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:22.339
Sometimes, they die because of how frustrating it is.

785
01:07:29.249 --> 01:07:30.889
It's just a joke.

786
01:07:30.889 --> 01:07:32.650
Let's talk about it over lunch.

787
01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.719
Okay.

788
01:07:36.459 --> 01:07:39.759
By the way,

789
01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.900
you are really not good at making jokes.

790
01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:48.570
Many people said that's my charm.

791
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.339
I see.

792
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.009
- I'm here. - You are!

793
01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:11.860
They don't have a menu.

794
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.089
Do you want me to surprise you?

795
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:15.560
Of course.

796
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:18.770
Can I have pajeon and golbaengi soup?

797
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:20.129
We also want three bottles of makgeolli.

798
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.370
Three bottles?

799
01:08:24.039 --> 01:08:25.139
I'm sorry.

800
01:08:25.139 --> 01:08:27.270
We want four bottles.

801
01:08:32.009 --> 01:08:33.110
Cheers!

802
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.759
You are really enjoying it.

803
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:47.730
I am today.

804
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.799
I haven't drank for a while.

805
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:52.169
Do you not drink with your husband?

806
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.139
My husband?

807
01:08:57.339 --> 01:09:00.669
We only drink beer while watching soccer.

808
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:05.110
He's pretty weird.

809
01:09:05.849 --> 01:09:08.349
I haven't seen him drunk once.

810
01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:11.950
I guess you guys are being careful with each other.

811
01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:15.419
Yes, that's how we are.

812
01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:21.060
We have each other's "The Room 19".

813
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:24.499
- "The Room 19"? - Yes.

814
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:29.400
It's each other's own space. It can't be invaded.

815
01:09:31.509 --> 01:09:33.469
That sounds great.

816
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.639
- Do you really think so? - Of course.

817
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.679
Even though you are married, you need that.

818
01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:43.150
If you love each other, you need to be more careful.

819
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.560
Why are you not married?

820
01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.799
Are you talking about me?

821
01:09:55.799 --> 01:09:56.900
Yes.

822
01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:00.629
I mean, you are very attractive and strong.

823
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.700
So I am curious why you are still single.

824
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.539
I'm just curious. That's all.

825
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.179
Maybe it's because I'm married.

826
01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:14.580
Did I offend you?

827
01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.879
You didn't.

828
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.919
I also had those thoughts when I was young.

829
01:10:19.589 --> 01:10:22.520
"Why is she not married when she's old enough?"

830
01:10:23.089 --> 01:10:27.599
I thought I would get married one day. There was no doubt.

831
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:38.110
I got married once if I can call it like that.

832
01:10:40.839 --> 01:10:44.749
I lived with my boyfriend back in university.

833
01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:47.950
Did you just live with him?

834
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.020
That's awesome.

835
01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.490
It wasn't that awesome as it sounds.

836
01:10:57.789 --> 01:11:00.360
We were dating, and I got pregnant with his baby.

837
01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:03.999
So we promised to get married...

838
01:11:04.629 --> 01:11:06.099
and lived together first.

839
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:11.810
You want to know what happened next?

840
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.509
Yes, to be honest.

841
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:23.450
I miscarried my baby and we broke up.

842
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:27.520
His family was against our relationship too.

843
01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:35.730
Gosh, you're so transparent...

844
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.530
that it makes me go transparent too.

845
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.799
This is why I shouldn't have a drink with people like you.

846
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:46.410
Sorry,

847
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:49.780
I shouldn't have asked you this question.

848
01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:51.849
No, it's good.

849
01:11:52.379 --> 01:11:55.219
It's a privilege of getting old every year.

850
01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:59.219
My painful experiences are just memories now.

851
01:12:07.759 --> 01:12:08.799
Here.

852
01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.370
Maybe I...

853
01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.499
knew it already then.

854
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.110
- Shall we drink? - Sure.

855
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:28.679
That this person...

856
01:12:29.549 --> 01:12:31.450
is his Room 19.

857
01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:33.919
And...

858
01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.560
The person you've dialed is not available.

859
01:12:41.099 --> 01:12:43.730
(Wife)

860
01:12:44.599 --> 01:12:47.740
Maybe he knew it too...

861
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:52.139
that he would have to face his room...

862
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:55.080
some day.

863
01:13:02.219 --> 01:13:03.480
I...

864
01:13:04.549 --> 01:13:06.889
knew it the moment I saw you.

865
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:10.190
That you're my style.

866
01:13:10.789 --> 01:13:13.360
Really? Thank you.

867
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:16.959
It makes me feel so great...

868
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:19.629
to hear you say that.

869
01:13:21.639 --> 01:13:23.099
Ms. Yoon.

870
01:13:23.469 --> 01:13:26.639
Don't worry about that punk at all.

871
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:29.110
I'll teach him a lesson.

872
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:30.849
Jerk.

873
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:34.179
I should tie up those guys like him...

874
01:13:34.419 --> 01:13:38.219
and cut what's in the middle so that they won't work as men again.

875
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:43.789
- Ms. Ko, you're crazy. - What?

876
01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:47.060
You're crazy.

877
01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.060
Ms. Yoon, it hurts.

878
01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.370
Ma'am, we're almost there.

879
01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.039
- Like this. - That's right.

880
01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.509
Ms. Yoon, is this the right place?

881
01:13:58.009 --> 01:13:59.110
Yes?

882
01:13:59.709 --> 01:14:02.610
You can drop me off here.

883
01:14:08.549 --> 01:14:10.620
Ms. Yoon, are you sure this is the right place?

884
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.150
Ms. Ko.

885
01:14:13.289 --> 01:14:14.959
Well... Actually,

886
01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:17.530
I really need to go to a toilet now. I'll come right back.

887
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:28.999
She's such a nice person.

888
01:14:30.539 --> 01:14:34.139
She's such a nice person. Don't you think so?

889
01:14:34.839 --> 01:14:35.839
Yes.

890
01:14:37.379 --> 01:14:39.150
Why do nice people...

891
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:41.549
all come at once?

892
01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.480
Relations are so sad...

893
01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.249
because we can't...

894
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.320
see them coming.

895
01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:23.219
His Room 19 and mine...

896
01:15:25.589 --> 01:15:27.030
have opened.

897
01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:51.820
(Because This Is My First Life)

898
01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.219
Shall we sleep together again tonight?

899
01:15:54.919 --> 01:15:56.520
- Ko Jung Min? - Gosh!

900
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.490
However I explain, it'll hurt her.

901
01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:00.929
Because she's a transparent person.

902
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:03.700
Why does the wound deepen...

903
01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:06.499
when someone comes along?

904
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:10.139
I'm Ji Ho's husband. Will that affect you...

905
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.539
in working with her?

906
01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:13.570
You said you'd profess to Ji Ho.

907
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.480
You said all three of them were too cheesy.

908
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.349
I was worried about just one person.

909
01:16:19.509 --> 01:16:20.650
Shall we...
