00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.160
(Episode 36)

2
00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:10.968
- What? - I said...

3
00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:14.208
- Hey, you're here. - Hi.

4
00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:19.208
What? Did you give it to this actress?

5
00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:20.648
Of course we did.

6
00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:24.087
How could you? Don't you have any business ethics?

7
00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:26.148
What do you mean no business ethics?

8
00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:29.017
Come on. I gave it to her too.

9
00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:31.028
She already received seven.

10
00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:32.857
We are only one of them.

11
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:37.198
I can't be nice to you if you act like this.

12
00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:38.927
How can you cause so much harm?

13
00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:40.198
What harm?

14
00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:44.067
Your drama will be airing at the same time as mine.

15
00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.437
Don't you feel bad for me?

16
00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.708
Hey, don't be unreasonable.

17
00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.177
I knew this was going to happen.

18
00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:51.908
I knew I'd be getting the short end of the stick.

19
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.577
I knew Mr. Park would be favorable to you.

20
00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:55.747
It's not like that.

21
00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:57.088
Of course it is.

22
00:00:57.317 --> 00:01:00.787
Did you not receive any benefit Mr. Park gave you?

23
00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:03.717
You're going too far.

24
00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:05.258
I'll have to talk to Mr. Park.

25
00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:07.198
Don't be like that because of me.

26
00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:09.297
Don't pretend to care about him.

27
00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:12.097
You were so mean to Mr. Park.

28
00:01:12.097 --> 00:01:13.398
What did I do?

29
00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:14.538
You rejected him.

30
00:01:15.997 --> 00:01:18.308
Have you ever been rejected by someone you love?

31
00:01:18.838 --> 00:01:20.407
Do you know how much that hurts?

32
00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:32.618
Hello. Is Mr. Park in?

33
00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:34.558
He didn't come to work again.

34
00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:43.357
(Mr. Park Jung Woo)

35
00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:02.217
What brings you here?

36
00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:08.258
Are you sick?

37
00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.027
Why aren't you coming to work?

38
00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:12.888
I've been working non-stop.

39
00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:14.397
I want to take a break.

40
00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:17.668
- Have you eaten? - No.

41
00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:19.367
I'll cook for you.

42
00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:22.198
No, I'll cook.

43
00:02:22.737 --> 00:02:24.707
I don't want you to say I put you to work.

44
00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:26.207
I won't say that.

45
00:02:26.908 --> 00:02:28.237
I'll really cook for you.

46
00:02:37.948 --> 00:02:39.888
- Do you cook? - A bit.

47
00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:42.388
Do you?

48
00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:44.057
I'm good at eating.

49
00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:53.867
It's good.

50
00:02:54.337 --> 00:02:55.797
Is there anything you can't do?

51
00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:59.068
You have sauce on your face like a kid.

52
00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:12.748
I lived here until I was 12.

53
00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:15.258
Until my dad's business failed.

54
00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:18.087
When I lived here,

55
00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:20.188
my parents fought,

56
00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:23.767
and creditors came to put red seizure stickers.

57
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.468
All sorts of bad things happened.

58
00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:31.237
But why did I think I was happy?

59
00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:35.538
Wasn't it because you were together?

60
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.107
With the ones you loved?

61
00:03:44.918 --> 00:03:47.818
I thought trust was way more valuable than love.

62
00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:56.427
I'll do the dishes.

63
00:03:57.698 --> 00:03:58.968
Just leave it. I'll do it.

64
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.668
No. I have to do my share for the food.

65
00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:01.858
(Lee Hyun Soo)

66
00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:06.327
Hello.

67
00:05:07.368 --> 00:05:09.767
Mr. Park. I have something to tell you.

68
00:05:23.748 --> 00:05:25.948
I mentioned your name, and they set this up for me.

69
00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:29.417
What's up?

70
00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:32.227
Don't I have good posture now?

71
00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:35.428
It's not bad.

72
00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:40.298
Show me how it's done.

73
00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:43.068
What do you want to tell me?

74
00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:44.438
Why are you stalling?

75
00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:10.767
I lied to you.

76
00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:13.868
Before...

77
00:06:15.998 --> 00:06:17.667
when I said...

78
00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:21.037
you weren't my type.

79
00:06:26.378 --> 00:06:27.777
You are my type.

80
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:41.097
I lied again.

81
00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:48.698
If only...

82
00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:52.467
I haven't met Jung Sun again.

83
00:06:59.647 --> 00:07:01.548
But there are no ifs in life.

84
00:07:07.957 --> 00:07:09.988
Whether I'm fooled or not, I'll make the decision.

85
00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:11.928
But...

86
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:14.128
it won't be easy to fool me.

87
00:07:14.798 --> 00:07:17.568
Don't you feel uncomfortable making people do something?

88
00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:20.397
I change my mind easily. I'm like that.

89
00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:21.868
I want to make a family.

90
00:07:22.837 --> 00:07:24.407
Family is a choice for me now.

91
00:07:25.308 --> 00:07:26.368
With you,

92
00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:28.907
I think I can live happily.

93
00:07:58.368 --> 00:08:00.477
Your problem is that you think too much.

94
00:08:00.977 --> 00:08:02.108
Especially about love.

95
00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:04.448
Do what you feel like.

96
00:08:05.207 --> 00:08:08.277
You can't be alone because of an unsubstantiated feeling.

97
00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:09.417
Stop it already.

98
00:08:10.517 --> 00:08:12.587
Stop longing for a man you can't be with.

99
00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:14.517
I am your reality.

100
00:08:25.498 --> 00:08:27.198
Are you afraid to be loved?

101
00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:28.998
Are you making fun of me?

102
00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:32.807
If what I have looks better on someone else,

103
00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:34.338
I can't really hang on to it.

104
00:08:34.537 --> 00:08:36.238
Because it reminds me of that person.

105
00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:43.277
I got dumped before I came to Paris.

106
00:08:44.248 --> 00:08:46.218
She says work is more important to her than love.

107
00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:49.358
She's ambitious. I like that.

108
00:08:51.187 --> 00:08:54.157
Sometimes you choose your lifetime partner based on trust.

109
00:08:55.098 --> 00:08:57.128
I wanted to let you know that you have me.

110
00:09:01.397 --> 00:09:02.498
Is this all you have?

111
00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:07.338
You should get angry when you are angry.

112
00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:10.238
I'm telling you that I'll take your woman.

113
00:09:11.578 --> 00:09:13.878
It takes 2 to love, not 1.

114
00:09:14.578 --> 00:09:17.047
No matter how much we fight, the outcome isn't about winning.

115
00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:18.287
Why do we have to have this fight?

116
00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:46.677
- Keep it up. - Okay.

117
00:09:49.118 --> 00:09:50.118
Great.

118
00:09:52.817 --> 00:09:54.388
- Medium rare. - Okay.

119
00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:55.388
(Good Soup)

120
00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:01.527
(Lunch course menu)

121
00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:07.838
Hello.

122
00:10:10.407 --> 00:10:12.638
I thought you didn't remember me...

123
00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:14.537
because you didn't say hi earlier.

124
00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.677
Of course I remember you.

125
00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:20.878
I'm here because you guys are hot after getting the Michelin star.

126
00:10:21.348 --> 00:10:22.848
You know I love hot stuff.

127
00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:25.118
Yes, ma'am. We'll do our best.

128
00:10:31.758 --> 00:10:32.828
(Lunch course: 2)

129
00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:35.858
2 lunch courses on table 9.

130
00:10:35.858 --> 00:10:37.267
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

131
00:10:38.998 --> 00:10:41.638
Chef On. Table number nine...

132
00:10:41.638 --> 00:10:42.667
What about it?

133
00:10:42.697 --> 00:10:44.307
She's a notoriously mean blogger.

134
00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:47.437
She used someone else's name for the reservation, so I didn't know.

135
00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:50.037
Please pay attention to the food.

136
00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:51.047
I will.

137
00:10:59.248 --> 00:11:00.317
Mother.

138
00:11:10.027 --> 00:11:12.828
I ordered your favorite coffee.

139
00:11:13.697 --> 00:11:16.238
I don't want to drink Kenya AA today.

140
00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:17.667
Then order something else.

141
00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:19.167
Hyun Soo.

142
00:11:21.078 --> 00:11:22.078
Yes?

143
00:11:23.138 --> 00:11:26.578
I think the two of us have a lot in common.

144
00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:30.687
I broke up with Daniel too.

145
00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:37.427
But I'm back together with Jung Sun.

146
00:11:40.858 --> 00:11:42.527
Then is it only me?

147
00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:45.828
Isn't Jung Sun going to Hong Kong?

148
00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:47.738
He said he won't go.

149
00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:52.767
He didn't even tell me that.

150
00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:56.478
I thought he was in Hong Kong all this time.

151
00:11:57.978 --> 00:11:59.348
That's upsetting.

152
00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:02.047
I was trying so hard...

153
00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:05.817
not to show how much I was suffering from the breakup.

154
00:12:06.917 --> 00:12:08.958
How can he do this to me?

155
00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:10.657
He didn't get a chance.

156
00:12:10.657 --> 00:12:12.687
He had to cancel his Hong Kong move, and Good Soup...

157
00:12:12.687 --> 00:12:15.358
Why are you making excuses for my son?

158
00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:17.128
Mother.

159
00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:21.738
What we have common is that we are both dating younger men.

160
00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:22.797
So?

161
00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:25.738
We should comfort each other when we're troubled.

162
00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:29.777
That's something people in common can do for each other.

163
00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:32.447
How are you so good at talking?

164
00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:34.547
You're just as good as me.

165
00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:37.317
I can never beat Jung Sun in an argument.

166
00:12:37.817 --> 00:12:40.248
He got that from you.

167
00:12:40.588 --> 00:12:42.888
Daniel is so strange.

168
00:12:43.057 --> 00:12:45.228
We were doing just fine the day before.

169
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:47.697
What did he say when he broke up with you?

170
00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:49.258
He was too scared...

171
00:12:50.027 --> 00:12:53.998
to break up with me in person. He left a note.

172
00:12:54.368 --> 00:12:55.868
That's the worst.

173
00:12:56.437 --> 00:12:57.767
It's not the worst.

174
00:12:58.407 --> 00:13:00.167
I've seen worse.

175
00:13:01.978 --> 00:13:04.478
I want to go to his school to find him,

176
00:13:04.478 --> 00:13:07.578
but I can't do that when he wrote he was too scared...

177
00:13:08.177 --> 00:13:09.378
to see me in person.

178
00:13:10.718 --> 00:13:12.647
What are your plans?

179
00:13:12.988 --> 00:13:14.187
It's not like...

180
00:13:14.988 --> 00:13:17.057
I ask for a lot of money.

181
00:13:18.258 --> 00:13:20.088
He got annoyed because I asked him for money.

182
00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:22.728
Then he broke up because of money?

183
00:13:22.858 --> 00:13:24.868
You wouldn't want to be together if someone gets annoyed.

184
00:13:25.197 --> 00:13:26.797
It was money in the end.

185
00:13:27.498 --> 00:13:30.638
Why are people slaves for money?

186
00:13:31.008 --> 00:13:32.508
What's so great about money?

187
00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:35.277
- Mother. - Yes?

188
00:13:36.208 --> 00:13:39.578
When I wanted to become a writer, I made 800 dollars a month.

189
00:13:39.878 --> 00:13:42.618
My sister was the one to nag at me the worst.

190
00:13:43.248 --> 00:13:45.348
Money beats over everything. Even family.

191
00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:48.088
Who will pay for coffee today?

192
00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:52.287
Usually, the one who asks to meet should pay,

193
00:13:52.888 --> 00:13:55.197
but you're in a crisis.

194
00:13:55.797 --> 00:13:56.927
So I'll pay.

195
00:14:03.098 --> 00:14:04.138
Jung Woo!

196
00:14:05.638 --> 00:14:08.537
Do you know how worried I was when I heard you missed work?

197
00:14:08.777 --> 00:14:11.208
Were you so worried that you made just one call?

198
00:14:11.307 --> 00:14:13.878
That's because I thought I might bother you.

199
00:14:15.047 --> 00:14:18.047
Hong Jin told me you said we can't use a new camera team.

200
00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:21.687
What's wrong? This is my drama, but also Hyun Soo's.

201
00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:23.057
Did you forget about her?

202
00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:24.657
How can I forget?

203
00:14:25.228 --> 00:14:27.027
Right? You'll make it happen for us, right?

204
00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958
No.

205
00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:33.167
- Hey. - Don't get on.

206
00:14:35.397 --> 00:14:38.608
What's wrong? Why are you doing this to me? It's me, Joon Ha.

207
00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:40.368
I know you're Joon Ha.

208
00:14:41.238 --> 00:14:45.307
I'm so sick of picking up after you two.

209
00:14:46.978 --> 00:14:48.017
Jung Woo!

210
00:14:57.488 --> 00:14:59.057
That will be 197 dollars.

211
00:15:00.598 --> 00:15:03.197
You need the manager to give you another training.

212
00:15:03.998 --> 00:15:06.368
My next column will be on Good Soup.

213
00:15:08.598 --> 00:15:09.638
Ma'am!

214
00:15:12.838 --> 00:15:13.907
What's wrong?

215
00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:16.078
She didn't pay.

216
00:15:18.047 --> 00:15:19.708
I better tell the chef.

217
00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:38.927
You're really here. How can you do this?

218
00:15:39.598 --> 00:15:42.238
Why should I hear you didn't go to Hong Kong from Hyun Soo?

219
00:15:42.598 --> 00:15:44.437
At least you found out.

220
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:48.608
I didn't want you to worry, so I tried not to contact you.

221
00:15:48.978 --> 00:15:51.748
It's not like we ever shared such small things.

222
00:15:51.748 --> 00:15:54.248
This is not something small. It's huge.

223
00:15:54.618 --> 00:15:55.777
Why didn't you leave?

224
00:15:56.348 --> 00:15:58.917
Did you give up the job because of Hyun Soo?

225
00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:00.588
Yes.

226
00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:10.612
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E36 Temperature of Love "You Rejected Him"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

227
00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:17.868
What's wrong?

228
00:16:18.537 --> 00:16:20.008
Daniel left me.

229
00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.218
Do you like Hyun Soo that much?

230
00:16:27.978 --> 00:16:29.517
Enough to give up on a good opportunity?

231
00:16:30.488 --> 00:16:31.517
Yes.

232
00:16:35.088 --> 00:16:37.657
Why haven't I found myself a man like that?

233
00:16:39.228 --> 00:16:42.258
Aren't I prettier than Hyun Soo although I'm older?

234
00:16:42.657 --> 00:16:43.657
Mom?

235
00:16:47.098 --> 00:16:49.067
I got married at the age of 27...

236
00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:51.537
and thought that I would have a beautiful life.

237
00:16:51.537 --> 00:16:54.578
But my husband told me to only follow his orders.

238
00:16:54.937 --> 00:16:57.807
Even the neighborhood dog can go where he wants.

239
00:16:57.807 --> 00:16:59.177
Not this again.

240
00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:01.947
You always do this whenever you have a breakup.

241
00:17:01.947 --> 00:17:04.548
I always listened to them,

242
00:17:05.048 --> 00:17:07.118
and I try my best to be considerate.

243
00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:09.088
Why do they leave me?

244
00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:13.657
It looked like Hyun Soo broke up with you first,

245
00:17:14.427 --> 00:17:15.927
but you still came back to her.

246
00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:19.768
Why do they only leave me? Why don't they hold onto me?

247
00:17:20.697 --> 00:17:22.737
Did you say the same thing to Hyun Soo?

248
00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:26.868
No. I have pride, you know.

249
00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:28.407
It would be embarrassing.

250
00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:32.447
You're my child. You've seen it all already.

251
00:17:34.878 --> 00:17:36.447
I want to spend the night here.

252
00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:43.588
("Good Soup", Yeon Woo)

253
00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:45.788
Aside from the main cast, did you get a list of supporting roles?

254
00:17:45.788 --> 00:17:46.788
Yes.

255
00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:51.497
- Gosh. I'm so mad. - What is it?

256
00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:54.638
Jung Woo's acting strangely. Did he go insane?

257
00:17:55.268 --> 00:17:57.167
He shouldn't treat me like this.

258
00:17:57.737 --> 00:17:59.707
- Did he say no to the camera? - He said no.

259
00:17:59.768 --> 00:18:02.007
You should go and talk to him. No.

260
00:18:02.007 --> 00:18:03.947
He didn't budge even when I mentioned you.

261
00:18:04.808 --> 00:18:07.477
Then what about casting?

262
00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:09.078
What about Choi Ra Joon? Will Hong Ah's drama take her?

263
00:18:09.217 --> 00:18:11.318
I talked to Choi Ra Joon's agency.

264
00:18:11.318 --> 00:18:13.388
They want to see the next script too.

265
00:18:13.388 --> 00:18:15.588
Does this mean we have a chance?

266
00:18:15.588 --> 00:18:17.858
I think we just need to meet their conditions.

267
00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:21.098
International copyright and shares for merchandises.

268
00:18:21.098 --> 00:18:23.128
Mr. Park can make that happen.

269
00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:26.268
You're the best at persuading him.

270
00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:28.167
I'll go see him.

271
00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:30.197
I can't let someone else take her.

272
00:18:52.157 --> 00:18:53.757
Are you taking a break?

273
00:18:54.058 --> 00:18:55.858
You shouldn't be like this.

274
00:18:56.358 --> 00:18:59.068
You're the one who shouldn't be here.

275
00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:02.068
We met with Choi Ra Joon's agency,

276
00:19:02.068 --> 00:19:03.907
and they'll likely sign with us if we meet their conditions.

277
00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:04.967
Did you hear?

278
00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:12.378
(Choi Ra Joon Agrees to Work with Writer Kim Yu Kyung)

279
00:19:12.378 --> 00:19:14.147
They're famous for this.

280
00:19:17.118 --> 00:19:18.487
What do we do now?

281
00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:22.518
You should just be faithful at what you do.

282
00:19:22.917 --> 00:19:26.128
I won't allow you to pester me like this again.

283
00:19:26.858 --> 00:19:28.497
Are you mad at me?

284
00:19:29.128 --> 00:19:31.997
- No. - Why are you treating me like this?

285
00:19:34.237 --> 00:19:35.868
In entertainment,

286
00:19:36.598 --> 00:19:39.538
we're supposed to make products to entertain others.

287
00:19:40.778 --> 00:19:41.838
And?

288
00:19:43.207 --> 00:19:46.477
I thought about how I've been treating myself.

289
00:19:48.848 --> 00:19:51.818
Now, can you leave?

290
00:19:52.247 --> 00:19:53.348
I want to listen to music.

291
00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:56.318
This is hard for me to get used to.

292
00:19:56.687 --> 00:19:59.757
Please don't change. I don't like it.

293
00:20:00.497 --> 00:20:02.497
You remind me of a guy I know.

294
00:20:08.368 --> 00:20:11.007
- I'm not late, am I? - No.

295
00:20:12.068 --> 00:20:15.237
Why don't you want to watch a late night movie?

296
00:20:15.878 --> 00:20:17.947
It's about time we make a decision.

297
00:20:18.707 --> 00:20:20.207
We've been seeing each other long enough.

298
00:20:20.977 --> 00:20:21.977
What decision?

299
00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:29.417
I thought we were already dating.

300
00:20:30.018 --> 00:20:33.588
I thought you only said that to take the pressure off of me.

301
00:20:33.927 --> 00:20:37.268
I wanted to treat you well. Was it not enough?

302
00:20:37.868 --> 00:20:40.068
No, you've been more than enough.

303
00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:42.997
I'm glad.

304
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.368
That's why I won't date you.

305
00:20:46.608 --> 00:20:48.378
What do you mean?

306
00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:50.947
I know you're trying really hard.

307
00:20:52.247 --> 00:20:54.118
Just like how you worked to become a sous chef.

308
00:20:57.388 --> 00:20:59.388
Even if you don't try,

309
00:20:59.747 --> 00:21:02.457
some things just happen naturally.

310
00:21:03.018 --> 00:21:04.028
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:04.487 --> 00:21:06.257
I'll just let things happen instead of trying.

312
00:21:10.098 --> 00:21:12.268
This is why I liked you.

313
00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:17.667
However, it's not going to work with Hong Ah.

314
00:21:21.108 --> 00:21:23.177
I want to keep on working at Good Soup.

315
00:21:23.977 --> 00:21:25.677
Would it make you uncomfortable?

316
00:21:26.947 --> 00:21:30.118
If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll leave.

317
00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:41.957
I'm Lim Soo Jung, the sommelier.

318
00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:49.538
I'm the sous chef, Choi Won Joon.

319
00:22:31.778 --> 00:22:33.177
Why are you dropping by so late?

320
00:22:33.177 --> 00:22:34.618
I didn't get to see you today.

321
00:22:35.477 --> 00:22:36.878
I met with your mother.

322
00:22:37.417 --> 00:22:40.147
I know. I came out because of her.

323
00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:42.318
- Why? - She's in my bed.

324
00:22:42.318 --> 00:22:43.588
She refuses to go home.

325
00:22:45.788 --> 00:22:48.028
It suffocates me to be in the same room with her.

326
00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:52.328
What is it?

327
00:22:52.727 --> 00:22:54.237
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

328
00:22:54.937 --> 00:22:56.568
I better start looking now.

329
00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:01.038
Kyung is here.

330
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:26.528
Hyun Soo, aren't you going to sleep?

331
00:23:26.528 --> 00:23:28.598
I'm just about to. Don't come out!

332
00:23:33.338 --> 00:23:34.778
- Hyun Soo! - Yes?

333
00:23:34.778 --> 00:23:35.778
(Mom)

334
00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:37.407
I'm going to bed.

335
00:23:45.147 --> 00:23:46.147
Is she not picking up?

336
00:23:47.088 --> 00:23:49.118
This isn't going to work. I better go home.

337
00:23:49.118 --> 00:23:50.118
I'll come with you.

338
00:23:50.257 --> 00:23:52.528
No. You have a good image of her.

339
00:23:52.628 --> 00:23:53.727
That's all you need to see.

340
00:23:54.257 --> 00:23:56.058
- Call me. - Okay.

341
00:24:06.907 --> 00:24:08.578
Mom! Mom!

342
00:24:09.138 --> 00:24:10.808
Don't shake me.

343
00:24:19.987 --> 00:24:21.858
I should've only taken one,

344
00:24:23.187 --> 00:24:24.628
but I couldn't fall asleep.

345
00:24:25.628 --> 00:24:27.558
This happened because I took two pills.

346
00:24:28.858 --> 00:24:30.157
Good job.

347
00:24:32.697 --> 00:24:34.568
I hung up while calling you...

348
00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:36.868
because I didn't want you to worry.

349
00:24:38.068 --> 00:24:40.368
I was going to get through it alone.

350
00:24:41.138 --> 00:24:42.578
You're really something.

351
00:24:43.038 --> 00:24:45.177
You don't call when you should, then you call when you shouldn't.

352
00:24:47.048 --> 00:24:48.147
Jung Sun.

353
00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:49.848
Yes?

354
00:24:51.487 --> 00:24:53.687
I really want to fix myself.

355
00:24:55.388 --> 00:24:57.657
I'm sick of living like this.

356
00:25:03.098 --> 00:25:05.167
Up until I was 27,

357
00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:07.768
things weren't so bad.

358
00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:11.108
No.

359
00:25:12.308 --> 00:25:15.907
Even until I was 35, it was fine.

360
00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:18.907
Right?

361
00:25:20.618 --> 00:25:22.318
Do you remember me then?

362
00:25:24.987 --> 00:25:26.147
I do.

363
00:25:28.487 --> 00:25:30.187
I was okay then, right?

364
00:25:31.288 --> 00:25:32.457
No.

365
00:25:33.588 --> 00:25:35.128
You were the best then.

366
00:25:44.538 --> 00:25:45.638
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:48.638
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:50.378 --> 00:25:52.747
I want you to become happy.

369
00:25:54.018 --> 00:25:56.677
I wish I could make that happen for you,

370
00:25:58.288 --> 00:25:59.687
but I'm not enough.

371
00:26:30.818 --> 00:26:31.848
Hello?

372
00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:33.788
Are you free today?

373
00:26:35.118 --> 00:26:36.487
I'm free during break time.

374
00:26:36.558 --> 00:26:37.657
I'll come by later.

375
00:26:38.657 --> 00:26:40.657
Debts keep people closer...

376
00:26:40.957 --> 00:26:42.128
than love.

377
00:26:43.927 --> 00:26:45.697
Let's settle our debt today.

378
00:27:13.388 --> 00:27:15.197
Out of the things I own,

379
00:27:16.098 --> 00:27:18.598
if there is something that suits someone else better,

380
00:27:19.268 --> 00:27:20.798
it's hard for me to keep it...

381
00:27:21.897 --> 00:27:23.338
because it reminds me of that other person.

382
00:27:25.368 --> 00:27:27.237
It still sounds corny.

383
00:27:30.078 --> 00:27:31.747
You have to get a beating from me today.

384
00:27:32.548 --> 00:27:34.878
Will that settle our debt?

385
00:27:36.318 --> 00:27:38.687
Do you want to get hit first or get hit after the talk?

386
00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:40.788
I'll hear it first and try to avoid getting hit.

387
00:27:56.868 --> 00:27:59.268
(Temperature of Love)

388
00:28:00.068 --> 00:28:01.737
I wanted to try and shake you.

389
00:28:02.007 --> 00:28:04.207
If you can be shaken, I thought things could change.

390
00:28:04.207 --> 00:28:05.747
You don't have to mind me anymore.

391
00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:07.677
I won't get in your way.

392
00:28:07.917 --> 00:28:09.977
You just walked me home, and you're back again?

393
00:28:09.977 --> 00:28:11.348
I just keep on missing you.

394
00:28:11.348 --> 00:28:12.747
Why do you like me?

395
00:28:12.747 --> 00:28:16.457
I'll protect you so you would never have to lose yourself.

396
00:28:16.487 --> 00:28:18.187
I can't end it.

397
00:28:18.358 --> 00:28:19.588
I must have loved him.

398
00:28:19.628 --> 00:28:21.227
Are you just going to sit there and cry?

399
00:28:21.227 --> 00:28:22.227
Do you want me to go right away?

400
00:28:22.227 --> 00:28:24.397
Do you think they'll get married?

401
00:28:24.798 --> 00:28:26.028
I have something to say.
