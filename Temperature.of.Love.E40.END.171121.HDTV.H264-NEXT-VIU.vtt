(The Final Episode)

2
00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:12.355
Why did you want to talk to me?

3
00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:15.566
Did you tell Hyun Soo to renew her contract with my company?

4
00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:16.896
How can I say that?

5
00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:18.365
Why can't you?

6
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.505
Do you have that little influence over her?

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.935
I have influence,

8
00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:26.036
but I just don't to use it for that kind of thing.

9
00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:30.246
You won't be able to say that if you knew about all the things...

10
00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.115
I've done for you.

11
00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:35.445
I know that you took care of that power blogger.

12
00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:40.826
I'm mostly aware of all the things you do for me behind my back.

13
00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.225
Rumor spreads quickly.

14
00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.896
And you still can't do that for me?

15
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.566
Anything regarding me is okay.

16
00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.365
- Really? - Yes. Anything.

17
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:50.795
"Anything"?

18
00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:52.765
You just said "Anything". Okay?

19
00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:55.206
I didn't know you'd be here, Mr. Park.

20
00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:58.305
It's past lunchtime. You must have a lot of free time at work.

21
00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.676
I'm going to now because I don't want to see you.

22
00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:04.476
- My goodness. - Don't mock me.

23
00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.645
I'm not going to stop you if you're going to leave.

24
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:09.145
You can work with our company or not. Do whatever you want.

25
00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.515
Oh, really?

26
00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:14.955
I was going to renew my contract since On Entertainment is the best.

27
00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:17.925
But you just made me change my mind.

28
00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.765
Are you really going to be like this?

29
00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:22.466
Stop teasing him.

30
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.866
It's fun.

31
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.765
I'm going to go now. Have fun.

32
00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.106
I want you to come up with the next concept within this month.

33
00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:33.776
- Bye, Jung Woo. - See you.

34
00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:35.246
Why would I have to do that?

35
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:37.476
I didn't even decide if I'm going to stay or not.

36
00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:46.285
(My love, Joon)

37
00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:49.326
Hey, Won Joon. I'm going to head out now.

38
00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:52.595
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the grocery store to buy something.

39
00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:55.095
What's Jung Sun doing?

40
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.565
Jung Sun's having a talk with Hyun Soo.

41
00:01:57.996 --> 00:01:59.735
Are you his slave or something?

42
00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:01.106
Why do you need to go grocery shopping?

43
00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:02.435
I am his slave.

44
00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:07.946
I can only see you for 10 minutes. Would that be impossible?

45
00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.346
Why would you think that way?

46
00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:30.596
- Hello. - Hello.

47
00:02:33.906 --> 00:02:34.965
Here.

48
00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.476
You don't need to do this.

49
00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:41.606
It's okay. I'll do it.

50
00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.115
I was going to do it for you.

51
00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:10.906
Can you lower the music?

52
00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:14.076
Won Joon, how can you fall asleep when you're with me?

53
00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:17.545
I'm so tired these days because we have so many customers.

54
00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:19.316
You always had customers.

55
00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:23.356
I want to get off.

56
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:27.955
Won Joon.

57
00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:30.555
Lie down.

58
00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:39.536
You're cute.

59
00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:48.205
I visited my mom and dad.

60
00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:51.645
I told them we'd come over for dinner on your day off.

61
00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:54.985
Shouldn't we tell them that we're going to get married?

62
00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.156
Then they'll try to bring in all the formalities.

63
00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.156
But they might get upset for not knowing.

64
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.886
Every parent has a say in their children's wedding.

65
00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.295
I'm sure they're not going to go against it.

66
00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:05.895
But even if they do,

67
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:08.696
they won't have any influence on our decision.

68
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.835
I think it'd be better for them to hear...

69
00:04:11.096 --> 00:04:13.036
our decision while they eat.

70
00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:14.965
You just want them to accept what they hear?

71
00:04:15.806 --> 00:04:18.205
I can take care of my parents.

72
00:04:19.105 --> 00:04:20.676
- What about you? - My mom doesn't...

73
00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:23.046
think too much about that kind of stuff, so it'll be fine.

74
00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:25.515
But my dad...

75
00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:29.186
We need to go see your dad before we invite him to dinner.

76
00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:32.686
Don't you want to?

77
00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:35.756
No, it's something we need to face anyway.

78
00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:37.926
Then have we come to a decision?

79
00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.225
Yes.

80
00:04:42.025 --> 00:04:44.095
- Soo Jung. - Yes?

81
00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:45.895
Until when did you receive reservations?

82
00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:50.535
We're fully booked for this week and next week.

83
00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:52.636
We're free on Tuesday, the week after next.

84
00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:54.975
Then please don't take any reservations for that day.

85
00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:56.316
Why not?

86
00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:57.816
I want to invite some people over for dinner.

87
00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:26.676
I'm nervous.

88
00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:31.645
Don't be nervous. I'm here by your side.

89
00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:33.285
Okay.

90
00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:38.655
I'm a bit nervous...

91
00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:41.355
to cook for a chef.

92
00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:42.556
Don't worry.

93
00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:44.126
What matters most is the thought you put into it.

94
00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:45.655
Then I hope you enjoy.

95
00:05:46.626 --> 00:05:48.525
I can't seem to season things properly these days.

96
00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:50.535
What are you saying? It tastes amazing.

97
00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:54.066
It's delicious.

98
00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:55.506
It's tasty.

99
00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:58.835
It's delicious.

100
00:06:01.306 --> 00:06:02.605
This isn't your cooking.

101
00:06:02.676 --> 00:06:04.116
My gosh.

102
00:06:04.645 --> 00:06:06.816
I bought that one dish.

103
00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:11.486
It's okay, Mother. It still tastes delicious.

104
00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:12.816
Thank you.

105
00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:15.386
But their food tastes a little salty today.

106
00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:18.455
Exactly. Why did that have to happen today?

107
00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:25.395
Eat as much as you want,

108
00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:27.436
and let's meet up more comfortably.

109
00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:32.136
I'm also thinking about planning a future with her.

110
00:06:34.006 --> 00:06:35.076
Really?

111
00:06:37.215 --> 00:06:40.486
Good thinking. It's not good to date someone for too long.

112
00:06:41.746 --> 00:06:44.015
It's great to live together when you're young.

113
00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:46.785
My gosh, Dad. Stop it.

114
00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:51.556
- Eat up. - Okay.

115
00:06:56.895 --> 00:06:57.895
Hello.

116
00:07:01.835 --> 00:07:02.835
Drink some tea.

117
00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:06.806
You're beautiful as always.

118
00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.876
There's no need to point out the obvious.

119
00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:10.676
Let's eat lunch together later.

120
00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:14.486
I have a long list of men waiting. You better wait for your turn.

121
00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:18.986
(Flower)

122
00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:37.506
Honey.

123
00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:42.145
I'm not your honey.

124
00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:45.616
I'm sorry. I missed you.

125
00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:47.645
I missed you too.

126
00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:49.515
Thank you for dropping by.

127
00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:53.126
Right? You thought about me a lot, didn't you?

128
00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:55.756
I must've been out of my mind.

129
00:07:57.056 --> 00:08:01.395
I must've been out of my mind for a really long time.

130
00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:05.566
Daniel.

131
00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:07.665
Get lost.

132
00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:11.705
What? You said you missed me.

133
00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:14.076
Yes, I did. I wanted to dump you.

134
00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:17.275
I always got dumped until now.

135
00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:18.946
So I wanted to try dumping someone as well.

136
00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:20.746
Bye.

137
00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:26.285
Honey.

138
00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:29.386
Do you want me beat you up?

139
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.965
You're younger than me. Stop calling me "Honey".

140
00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:34.465
I'm no longer your honey.

141
00:08:45.036 --> 00:08:46.546
She's my fiancee.

142
00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:51.076
Hello. I'm Lee Hyun Soo.

143
00:08:53.485 --> 00:08:54.546
Please sit down.

144
00:08:57.855 --> 00:08:58.885
Here.

145
00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:01.556
Thank you.

146
00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:04.625
It's a Bluetooth speaker.

147
00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:08.095
Since doctors spend most of their time treating patients indoors,

148
00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:10.365
there are many doctors who love music.

149
00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:13.235
I figured it might be the same for you.

150
00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:17.036
I love music too.

151
00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:18.676
I listen to a lot of classical music.

152
00:09:19.776 --> 00:09:20.806
I see.

153
00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:25.416
What would you like to drink?

154
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.416
What do you do in your spare time?

155
00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:37.595
I usually listen to music and read books.

156
00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:40.026
What are you reading these days?

157
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:43.735
My friend sent me a book he wrote.

158
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.536
I read a couple of pages of it.

159
00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:49.465
Even if it's your friend's book, it's hard to read if it's boring.

160
00:09:49.465 --> 00:09:50.576
You're right.

161
00:09:56.276 --> 00:09:58.245
I'm talking too much today.

162
00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:04.215
I should get back now.

163
00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:06.955
It was nice seeing you.

164
00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:10.696
It was nice to meet you too.

165
00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:30.745
I've never seen my father talk that much about himself.

166
00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:32.446
When I go on interviews,

167
00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:35.816
it's surprising how many of them want to talk about themselves.

168
00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:38.385
- Really? - Yes. They want to be asked.

169
00:10:38.686 --> 00:10:40.426
But nobody asks about them.

170
00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:44.156
Everyone is careful because they don't want to impose.

171
00:10:44.156 --> 00:10:45.455
They're afraid.

172
00:10:45.455 --> 00:10:47.526
They fear that if they say something people won't like them.

173
00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:49.365
Is that so?

174
00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:56.705
Have we said hello to everyone that we're supposed to?

175
00:10:57.705 --> 00:10:58.975
There's one person left.

176
00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:11.231
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E40 Temperature of Love "She's My Fiancee"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

177
00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:21.095
You didn't eat yet, did you?

178
00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:24.196
No, I didn't.

179
00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:34.046
- You still hold it like that. - Did you change the grip?

180
00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:35.875
No. I still hold it like you.

181
00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:39.845
You take over. I need to prepare the steak.

182
00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:43.455
Jung Woo.

183
00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:46.485
Make some time for me next Tuesday afternoon.

184
00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:48.085
Let me check my schedule first.

185
00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:51.495
I told the others to come over for lunch.

186
00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:52.826
And?

187
00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:54.865
I think I should tell you.

188
00:11:55.826 --> 00:11:58.196
What is it? Are you getting married?

189
00:11:58.536 --> 00:11:59.566
Bingo.

190
00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:13.016
- Good job. - Good job?

191
00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:15.546
Yes. Good job.

192
00:12:20.056 --> 00:12:22.725
I put a lot of noodles because you like them.

193
00:12:34.436 --> 00:12:36.475
- Grill these later. - Yes, Chef.

194
00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:39.705
- Don't overcook it. - Okay.

195
00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:43.146
There won't be anything difficult.

196
00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:44.875
The only thing is a lot of people are coming at once,

197
00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:46.115
so let's get things ready now.

198
00:12:46.546 --> 00:12:47.715
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

199
00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:19.046
- Mom. Dad. - Hi.

200
00:13:19.615 --> 00:13:20.745
This way.

201
00:13:21.585 --> 00:13:22.615
Please come in.

202
00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:26.385
Mom. Dad.

203
00:13:26.686 --> 00:13:28.455
I guess it's not just us.

204
00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:31.396
We invited all the people we know.

205
00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:32.896
We wanted everyone to have a meal together.

206
00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:34.926
That's great.

207
00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:37.465
- Let's sit. - Okay.

208
00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:43.576
Hi, Mother.

209
00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:46.906
Are you having a party? This is splendid.

210
00:13:46.906 --> 00:13:48.475
Your seat is over here.

211
00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:51.776
Do you mind sitting with my parents?

212
00:13:51.776 --> 00:13:52.845
Not at all.

213
00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:55.046
- Hello. - Hello.

214
00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:04.625
- Jung Woo. - Mr. Park, you're here.

215
00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:06.026
Come this way.

216
00:14:06.426 --> 00:14:07.666
Sit with my family.

217
00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:09.326
- Hi. - Long time no see.

218
00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:17.375
Hello.

219
00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:18.735
- Have you been well? - Yes.

220
00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:19.875
This is my family.

221
00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:22.475
She's your brother's girlfriend.

222
00:14:23.076 --> 00:14:24.516
- Hello. - Hello.

223
00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:25.916
Hi.

224
00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:31.686
By the way,

225
00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:35.125
if we go in together, won't Hyun Soo misunderstand?

226
00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.255
She will.

227
00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:38.355
But we aren't dating.

228
00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:41.196
- Let's go in. - Wait.

229
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:43.796
Then, are we dating?

230
00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:47.266
I'd be crazy if I didn't date you at this point.

231
00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:49.105
You aren't completely ignorant.

232
00:14:55.475 --> 00:14:56.516
Is this okay?

233
00:14:57.816 --> 00:15:01.416
You've suffered because of me. Let's go.

234
00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:10.156
There's something going on.

235
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.495
Something's going on.

236
00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:31.375
You seem to be enjoying your food, so I'm happy.

237
00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:33.385
Today...

238
00:15:35.316 --> 00:15:36.816
Jung Sun and I...

239
00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:39.885
will promise to each other that we'll walk our lives together.

240
00:15:54.735 --> 00:15:56.135
What is she saying?

241
00:15:57.735 --> 00:15:59.705
I think they're getting married.

242
00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:04.016
Is this a wedding?

243
00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:08.016
Goodness. They're so unusual.

244
00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:10.855
Please enjoy your meal.

245
00:16:27.865 --> 00:16:29.105
Congratulations!

246
00:16:35.276 --> 00:16:36.715
Jung Sun and I...

247
00:16:37.546 --> 00:16:41.286
have recorded our history of love for the past six years.

248
00:16:46.085 --> 00:16:49.156
My name is On Jung Sun. Do you want to go out with me?

249
00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:54.296
Being in love at first sight is physical and dangerous.

250
00:16:59.735 --> 00:17:01.605
We had made a few mistakes.

251
00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:05.776
Through those mistakes, we drifted apart then became close again.

252
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.905
Do you think it's just fun and games for me?

253
00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:11.816
Why do you only think about yourself?

254
00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:14.945
I allowed you to be in my life.

255
00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:19.256
Where did the straightforward and outspoken Lee Hyun Soo go?

256
00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:22.056
I have to walk on thin ice when I'm talking to you.

257
00:17:23.425 --> 00:17:26.056
The woman who thought love was a choice,

258
00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:29.326
and the man who thought love was a fate...

259
00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:32.066
decided to live together.

260
00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:35.635
Now I believe in fate.

261
00:17:35.935 --> 00:17:37.306
(I love you. I'm in love with you.)

262
00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.105
But we have to keep making choices...

263
00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:42.276
within the fate.

264
00:17:44.046 --> 00:17:45.875
Our love is destined,

265
00:17:46.716 --> 00:17:50.415
but breaking up is our choice and our responsibility.

266
00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:55.286
Our history of love...

267
00:17:56.996 --> 00:17:58.826
will continue to be written.

268
00:18:57.456 --> 00:18:59.016
(Temperature of Love)
